17</span>CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE OFFICE OF A NEW YORK
DETECTIVE</span></h2>
<p>The little clock in the dingy office of Eric Darrell was just
pointing out the hour of four when there came a rap on the
door.&nbsp; Within the proprietor sat alone, his feet elevated
upon the top of a desk, and from his position it was evident that
his thoughts were far away, for although he took an occasional
whiff at his cigar, it was in an absent-minded way.</p>
<p>At this summons, his interest was at once aroused&mdash;his
feet came down from their elevated position, and an expression
appeared on his face that might have been a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman, by Jove!&rdquo; he muttered, giving <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>his
handkerchief a flirt over the desk where his feet had been so
recently deposited.</p>
<p>There was no guess-work about this, neither had the detective
been able to distinguish anything feminine about the knock.</p>
<p>Over the door was a peculiar little contrivance, which by
means of several small mirrors would tell the occupant of the
office who summoned him&mdash;a useful affair under the
circumstances, as the detective might at some time have a visitor
bent on taking his life, and under such circumstances he would be
warned.</p>
<p>Jumping to his feet he approached the door&mdash;had it been a
man he probably would have sung out: &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; and
been done with it.</p>
<p>A lady stood there.</p>
<p>She was deeply veiled, and yet there was that about her dress
that bespoke the lady.</p>
<p>Darrell saw this at the first glance, and also judged from her
figure that she was young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this the office of Mr. Darrell?&rdquo; she asked, in
low, pleasing tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam,&rdquo; replied the other, respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am Eric Darrell, at your service.&nbsp; If you wish
to see me on business will you come in?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>He
stepped aside as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the lady entered the room, the detective closed the door,
and with the pressure of his thumb secured it so that no one
could enter without knocking.&nbsp; It was not his intention to
be rudely interrupted in his interview&mdash;he had from time to
time all sorts of visitors, and did not mean that one of the men
he employed should come in upon them while they were engaged in
talking.</p>
<p>The lady had already seated herself, and seemed to be looking
around the room, through her veil, with considerable
interest.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was her first visit to the office of a detective,
and she was taken with the strange assortment of mementoes that
hung around the room.</p>
<p>Eric Darrell swept his eyes about him, and something akin to a
smile came over his face as he viewed his curiosity
shop&mdash;there were scores and scores of murderous tools and
ingenious contrivances, each of which was connected with some
crime or criminal in the past history of New York, and in the
pursuit of his chosen business he had been brought into
connection with the affair or the individual.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>The
detective was a little proud of his collection, as well as the
Rogue&rsquo;s Gallery over the desk, where some hundreds of faces
were represented, many extremely brutal and some good-looking,
while the pictures of women were not infrequent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My clerk is out this afternoon, madam&mdash;we are
quite alone, so that you may speak without any fear of being
overheard,&rdquo; he said, as he took a chair, and sat down
facing his unknown client.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that, Mr. Darrell, for what I have to say
to you must be kept a dead secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective was more than ever convinced that he had to deal
with a young woman&mdash;her figure was exceedingly pleasing, and
her voice a sympathetic one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam, I am daily entrusted with secrets by all manner
of persons.&nbsp; You can rely upon it that anything you tell me
in confidence will be as safe as though whispered in the ear of a
father confessor.&nbsp; That is my business&mdash;we detectives
rival the family doctors in being made the repository of
secrets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was well put and quite reassuring, as he had intended it
should be.</p>
<p>The lady must have confidence in him now.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;Mr. Darrell, I want your assistance in a little
domestic matter.&nbsp; I am a young married woman&mdash;have been
married a year, and my husband is a man you would call one in a
thousand&mdash;a truthful, honorable gentleman, a favorite with
every one he knows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love him deeply, esteem his noble qualities, and
believe we could be happy through life, but there is a canker
sore eating my heart&mdash;Joe has a secret, a terrible secret,
and the knowledge of it is making me miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed a little overcome, and Darrell waited; meantime he
grimly thought to himself how many Joes here in this wicked city
of New York kept terrible secrets from their wives&mdash;yes, and
the boot was on the other leg too.</p>
<p>His business had brought him into contact with many such
scenes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon my feeling so badly, Mr. Darrell.&nbsp; These
things are an old story to you, but with me it means the wrecking
of my whole life, and I am weak enough to be troubled by
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hastened to reassure her that he fully sympathized with her
feelings.</p>
<p>Thus encouraged she went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever a woman had reason to trust her <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>husband I
have&mdash;and yet, as I said, Joe has a secret from me, the
knowledge of which is making me miserable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not have him ever suspect that I came to
consult you about it, but I am determined to know the
truth&mdash;I am his wife&mdash;if he is gambling in secret,
connected with any secret society or going to see some other
woman I am resolved to know the worst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hard for me to explain my position, Mr.
Darrell&mdash;I believe in and trust my husband as much as nearly
any woman could, but I know he is keeping something from me,
which excites my curiosity greatly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was an old story with Darrell.</p>
<p>He had seen other Joes before.</p>
<p>In his own mind he was immediately convinced that the man was
guilty.</p>
<p>He believed Joe to be an unmitigated scoundrel to treat his
young and pretty wife in this way&mdash;for the detective had
already decided this question and believed the owner of this
voice and figure must also be handsome.</p>
<p>So he began to dig for facts, a little ruthlessly perhaps,
because it was business.</p>
<p>Your professor of anatomy does not waste <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>time when
getting down to a certain nerve or muscle which he wishes to
expose to his class&mdash;the knife is applied without stint.</p>
<p>So the detective asked questions in order to expose as much of
the game as possible.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have no hint of the truth,
madam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before marriage, was your husband a man of the
world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always steady and quiet.&nbsp; I have never
heard that my Joe ever had an entangling alliance before we were
married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even this did not reassure Darrell&mdash;he was a little
skeptical with regard to such a man, being inclined to reflect
that still water runs deep.</p>
<p>His daily business brought him in contact with so much of the
evil of life that he had a rather poor opinion of mankind in
general&mdash;though ready to bow before woman&rsquo;s goodness,
even after having had experience with numerous confidence women
and others, who were more difficult to manage than male
criminals.</p>
<p>For instance, here was a case in point&mdash;a confiding,
loving wife&mdash;a cruel, deceiving husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand, madam.&nbsp; How long have these strange
visits been going on?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>&ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been aware of them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For two weeks.&nbsp; By accident I discovered that Joe
was in the habit of leaving his office at half-past four, and he
never reaches home until an hour and a half later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even this did not do more than pique me a little to
think he dallied so long, when he should have hurried home to
me&mdash;but three days later, again by accident, I saw him enter
a house on Twenty-seventh Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first I could not believe my eyes and I felt as
though I would swoon.&nbsp; It was just five o&rsquo;clock, and
he seemed in a dreadful hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What impressed me as being the strangest part of the
business, was the fact that he did not ring or even knock on the
door, but with a key let himself in as though he belonged
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course&mdash;Darrell&rsquo;s eyebrows went up, but he made
no remark&mdash;he could see through a millstone with a hole in
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why I hurried home but I did so with
a trembling heart.&nbsp; Joe came in at his usual time, and I
endeavored to be myself so that he might suspect nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the next day, however, something <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>impelled me
to go to Twenty-seventh Street again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Opposite to this house was a French restaurant, and
about ten minutes to five I entered here and ordered supper,
sitting at the window and yet far enough back not to be seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It lacked but one minute to five when Joe came down the
street from the elevated station, walking very fast, and went in
that house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sat there until twenty minutes of six, when he came
out again, and walked more slowly down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Darrell, I shall say nothing about my
feelings&mdash;you can understand them well enough.&nbsp; What I
want you to do is to discover who lives in that house, and why
Joe Leslie spends the better part of an hour there every
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&mdash;Joe Leslie&mdash;good heavens! it can&rsquo;t
be the Joe Leslie I know!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady seemed surprised at his words, and swept her veil
aside.</p>
<p>Then Darrell saw he had made no mistake in believing her to be
pretty&mdash;she was more than that, really handsome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband is Joseph Gregory Leslie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he is the man I know&mdash;a man whom I have
always believed the best of men, liked by <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>every one
acquainted with him.&nbsp; It seems incredible that he should be
engaged in anything of this character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because you know him, will you refuse to take my
case?&rdquo; she faltered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Mrs. Leslie&mdash;in fact, I shall do the
work all the more eagerly, hoping it may all prove to be a
mistake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I too hope so, but my heart is filled with fears.&nbsp;
I seem to have lived years since making this discovery.&nbsp; At
first I meant to ask my husband plainly to explain it, but
something held my tongue&mdash;for my life I could not&mdash;and
only as a last resort have I come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kindly write the number of the house here&mdash;you
know it, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is burned on my brain as with letters of
fire,&rdquo; and she obeyed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mrs. Leslie, you are to leave this matter in my
hands and think of it as little as you can.&nbsp; At home appear
as natural as you may, and believe that I will serve your
interests faithfully, first, last and all the time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe is a friend of mine, and yet if he is a
villain&mdash;which I cannot believe&mdash;I will discover the
proofs of it and hand them to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>&ldquo;Mr. Darrell, I thank you,&rdquo; she said, with
tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no occasion for it, madam&mdash;this is
business with me, leaving sentiment aside&mdash;I shall charge
you my regular price for such work; but at the same time I
honestly hope your husband will be able to prove his
innocence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; she said, solemnly.</p>
<p>At this moment there came a loud rap on the door&mdash;Mrs.
Leslie uttered a little scream, which was pretty well muffled by
the cobweb of a handkerchief she thrust up to her mouth.</p>
<p>As for Eric Darrell, the detective, he glanced up at the small
tell-tale mirror just inside the transom over the door&mdash;his
face was screwed up into a pucker, and pressing his finger on his
lips he said in a low voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a pretty kettle of fish!&nbsp; The man who
knocks is your husband, Mrs. Leslie.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TWO OF A KIND</span></h2>
<p>The pretty little lady came very near swooning when she heard
this.</p>
<p>Darrell arose from his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me through the inner office,&rdquo; he said
in low tones.</p>
<p>She followed him, trembling like a leaf, and looking back as
though she expected the door to be broken in, and an angry
husband to make his appearance on the scene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must have followed me&mdash;he will be so
angry&mdash;oh! what shall I do&mdash;how shall I look him in the
face again?&rdquo; she moaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He need not see you now&mdash;here is a door that lets
you out into the passage around the corner, and you can descend
the stairs without being discovered.&nbsp; As for looking him in
the face again, you have no reason to shun him, my dear
madam&mdash;you are innocent of wrong-doing at any rate, and if
anybody is going to be <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>ashamed let it be him.&nbsp;
Good-bye, madam, trust me to the utmost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him one pitiful look that haunted the old bachelor
for many days, and then, allowing her veil to fall over her
pretty face, passed on toward the stairs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the knock on the other door had been twice
repeated&mdash;the man without was evidently growing
impatient.</p>
<p>Mr. Darrell walked over to the door and opened it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! you, Leslie, my boy?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s good for
sore eyes to see your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They shook hands warmly.</p>
<p>Leslie walked in.</p>
<p>The detective had seen on the instant that his old-time friend
was disturbed&mdash;Joe&rsquo;s countenance had a gloomy look,
totally at variance to the cheerful expression that generally
marked it.</p>
<p>Of course Eric Darrell wondered to what he owed this
visit.</p>
<p>Was it brought about by the fact that Joe&rsquo;s wife had
just been seated in the very chair he now threw his long form
upon?</p>
<p>Since Joe&rsquo;s marriage he had seen very little of
him&mdash;their lines ran apart and seldom crossed, <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>yet they had
once been pretty good friends.&nbsp; Again the detective closed
the door and fastened it against interruption.</p>
<p>Whatever the cause of Leslie&rsquo;s visit, he meant to have a
quiet chat with him.</p>
<p>If the husband of the pretty lady who had just quitted his
office demanded to know why Lillian Leslie had visited him, he
would have to confess the truth, but he knew enough to keep a
close tongue until the lay of the land was made manifest.</p>
<p>Before sitting down himself he took up a box of cigars and
offered it to Joe.</p>
<p>The other looked at it rather sheepishly and then declined
with a wave of the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! sworn off, eh?&nbsp; Something I never expected
such an old smoker as you to do; but every man to his
taste.&nbsp; Now, old fellow, to what am I indebted for this
visit&mdash;a desire to talk over old times, or
business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leslie seemed to swallow a lump in his throat, and playing
nervously with the paper-cutter on the desk&mdash;which was a
dagger taken from a notorious assassin whom Darrell had assisted
to the gallows years before, said huskily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, you are the only man in the world I <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>would come to
with domestic troubles.&nbsp; What I am about to confide in you
now I do as to a friend.&nbsp; At the same time I ask for your
assistance in a professional way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he seemed lost in deep thought for a minute, and was no
doubt collecting his energies to speak to the point.</p>
<p>As for Eric Darrell, he surveyed the other in deepest
surprise.</p>
<p>What was coming?</p>
<p>Was Joe Leslie deep in the mire, and had he come to have his
old friend extricate him?</p>
<p>One thing seemed certain&mdash;he did not appear to know that
his pretty wife had been in this very room less than five minutes
before.</p>
<p>Believing this, the detective considered it a peculiar freak
of fate that these two should visit him on the same day and
almost the same hour, each without the knowledge of the
other.</p>
<p>At length Joe had recruited his energies to equal the
occasion.</p>
<p>He looked up.</p>
<p>The detective was leaning back in his chair and calmly
observing him, wreaths of blue white smoke curling up from his
Havana.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, you never met my wife?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>The
other did not by any start betray himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is your fault, old man.&nbsp; You were married in
Chicago, and after settling down here you never invited us old
bachelors to visit you,&rdquo; he replied, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive me.&nbsp; But see, here is her
photograph.&nbsp; Take a look at the girl who captured the man
who used to laugh at all Benedicts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell took the picture.</p>
<p>It was the same face he had so recently sat <i>vis-a-vis</i>
with in this very office, with one particular
difference&mdash;the photograph was of a happy, loving girl,
while the other had been the face of an anxious woman.</p>
<p>Mentally he noted this fact, while looking long and earnestly
at the photograph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of her?&rdquo; asked
Leslie.</p>
<p>He was a tall man, perhaps thirty-five years of age, not
handsome, but with a face that won him friends everywhere, for
Joe Leslie had a warm heart and was ready to champion the cause
of any poor devil in distress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s handsome, Joe&mdash;a beauty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyone can see that&mdash;look deeper, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see qualities there such as might make <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>her a wife to
be proud of, and whom any man might well hesitate to
offend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Joe groaned.</p>
<p>The shrewd detective thought he had driven one nail
home&mdash;that his allusion must have hit Leslie in a tender
spot&mdash;but for once he made a mistake.</p>
<p>Just then he was not thinking of his own
shortcomings&mdash;that groan was the result of mental agony
brought about by something else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, I am in trouble,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>The other knew it before he spoke.</p>
<p>To himself he was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, here&rsquo;s a surprising thing&mdash;I am already
retained by the wife, and the husband has come to confess his
sins.&nbsp; Shall I listen&mdash;he must not bind me to a promise
not to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aloud, he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for that, Joe.&nbsp; Tell me all about
it and heaven knows I will aid you all I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, old friend&mdash;I knew it before you
spoke&mdash;that was why I finally determined to come here and
unbosom myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; muttered Darrell, smiling
grimly.</p>
<p>He fully expected to learn the secret of that <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>mysterious
house on Twenty-seventh Street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To think,&rdquo; said Joe, looking around him at the
walls and ceiling, &ldquo;that here in this den where I spent so
many careless, happy bachelor hours with you, I should now be
detailing the tribulations of married life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Singular&mdash;of course,&rdquo; nodded Eric,
apparently observing the ashes on the end of his cigar, but all
the while watching Joe&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For of course,&rdquo; Joe continued, &ldquo;what I have
to say to you concerns&mdash;my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective was wondering how Joe meant to bring out his
confession.</p>
<p>He did not dream of anything else.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen that face, Eric&rdquo;&mdash;tapping the
photograph&mdash;&ldquo;would you say there was any deceit
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was something of a staggerer&mdash;the other had not
expected the electric fluid to strike in such a quarter at
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deceit&mdash;in that little woman&mdash;well, I&rsquo;m
an old bachelor, Joe, but my judgment is generally conceded
sound, and I tell you your wife is a woman of a thousand.&nbsp;
Her face speaks of purity and charity&mdash;one could not look
into the <a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>depths of those eyes and not read truth
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, man! you describe Lillian as I have
believed her&mdash;one would think you had met her,&rdquo; cried
Leslie, starting out of his moody fit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good photograph can be easily read nowadays, my
boy,&rdquo; replied Darrell, quietly; at the same time conscious
that he had made a break that had better not be repeated.</p>
<p>Joe gave a great sigh, and resumed his despondent attitude,
nervously playing with the paper-cutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, perhaps there are men who love their wives better
than I do mine, but I am completely wrapped up in Lillian, and if
I lost her I&rsquo;d go to the dogs devilish quick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know my nature&mdash;I&rsquo;m not a suspicious
fool, nor am I constitutionally jealous, but I suppose I have a
certain amount of the latter in my disposition&mdash;every man
but an idiot has.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so.&nbsp; Remember Othello&rsquo;s
declaration about keeping a corner in the object of his love for
other people&rsquo;s uses.&nbsp; I reckon that&rsquo;s the first
corner we have any record of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s face had flushed at the reference made by his
companion.</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>Quietly
he went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As heaven is my judge I do not wish to harbor any
unjust suspicion toward my wife&mdash;I would shield her with my
life from the folly of her imprudence, if such it prove to
be&mdash;but I am a man, and I cannot shut my eyes to certain
facts set before me.&nbsp; I have done everything in my power to
explain the matter to myself, offering all sorts of excuses for
her, but it is useless, and I feel now that I must know the truth
or go crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear fellow, this is indeed serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Serious, Eric&mdash;may you never know the awful
feeling that has pressed upon my heart during the last few
weeks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has it been that long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for two weeks I have noticed a difference in
Lillian&mdash;she has hardly looked me in the face at all.&nbsp;
Poor child, she is not accustomed to deceit, and a secret weighs
upon her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell came near laughing, as he believed he had the key to
the puzzle.&nbsp; Unaccustomed to deceit, forsooth&mdash;when it
was his own mysterious actions that had disturbed Lillian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two weeks, you say, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I knew something about it before <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>then.&nbsp;
Accident revealed it to me.&nbsp; I will tell you all, and you
can judge for yourself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know we live in a comfortable little house up on
Eighty-sixth Street.&nbsp; I generally spend my days down-town at
business, but I had a call up-town one morning, and my cabman
drove me past my own house&mdash;I took a cab because the party I
wished to see lived at a point inconvenient to the elevated, and
besides I had a bushel of papers, more or less, to take him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While passing my house I naturally looked in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At that moment Lillian was opening the door and a
fine-looking man entered whom she seemed to greet
cordially.&nbsp; I wondered who he was, but forgot all about him
until I came home in the evening.&nbsp; Somehow his face came up
again before me&mdash;I waited to see if she would speak, and
even made an opportunity for her to tell me of her
visitor&mdash;she said nothing and I thought looked a trifle
confused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, believe me, I dropped the matter then and
there&mdash;who could look into those eyes&mdash;well-springs of
truth as you have just observed&mdash;and believe deceit rested
there?</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>&ldquo;The next day I again found it necessary to use
the cab in going to the house of my client, and, as I passed my
own dwelling, I was somewhat nettled to see the same
military-looking gentleman ascending the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I looked at the time&mdash;it was ten exactly, the same
hour as on the preceding day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Again, that evening, I gave Lillian the opportunity to
tell me of her visitor, but she made no mention of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, the demon of jealousy had his birth in my heart
in that bitter hour&mdash;my wife had a secret from me&mdash;she
was receiving clandestinely a gentleman whom I did not even
know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I battled with the fever, heaven knows how terribly,
but it conquered me, and although I despised myself for doing so
despicable an act I set about watching Lillian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The large man buried his face in his hands and groaned aloud
in his suffering.</p>
<h2><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
39</span>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE TELL-TALE SCRAP OF PAPER</span></h2>
<p>Darrell had by this time come to the conclusion that he was
entering upon one of the oddest cases in his experience.</p>
<p>He had his sympathies aroused also, and while he generally
worked for conviction, in this instance it would be otherwise,
his desire being to prove the parties innocent.</p>
<p>Presently Leslie went on:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pretended to go to my office, but, instead, hovered
in the neighborhood, sometimes in the drug-store on the
corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus I have discovered that regularly every morning at
ten o&rsquo;clock, Saturday omitted, this fine-looking foreign
gentleman enters my house, and the door closes behind him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At eleven he appears again&mdash;it is always my wife
who lets him in and sees him to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, this thing is killing me&mdash;sooner than
believe Lillian could be false to me I <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>would discredit my own mother; and
yet here is something very, very strange&mdash;something that
must be explained before my peace of mind comes back to me
again.&nbsp; In a few words, I want you to find out who this man
is, and why he calls to see my wife invariably at ten
o&rsquo;clock when I am supposed to be down-town money-making,
and why she has never breathed one syllable of all this to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do it, Joe, for old friendship&rsquo;s sake, and
I most heartily pray it may turn out all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I haven&rsquo;t any doubt of that.&nbsp; My dear
fellow, don&rsquo;t imagine for an instant that I suspect my wife
of anything wrong, but&mdash;well, you see&mdash;hang it, Eric, I
must know the truth, and if my thoughts have wronged Lillian I
shall go down on my knees before the little woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On his part, Mr. Darrell had, while Joe was speaking,
conceived a sudden idea that would possibly explain the
matter.</p>
<p>He did not mention it, because the explanation hinged upon his
other client&rsquo;s case, but he kept it in mind all the
same.</p>
<p>It was to this effect:</p>
<p>Perhaps Lillian had sought the advice of some <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>other
detective before coming to him, and it was this party calling at
a certain hour every day to deliver his report, whom Joe had
seen.</p>
<p>Possibly little or no progress had been made, and hence she
had finally determined to change, just as a patient, becoming
dissatisfied with his doctor, calls in another physician.</p>
<p>Luck alone had brought her to his office&mdash;perhaps it was
the sweet little cherub that watches over the affairs of
lovers.</p>
<p>At any rate it was a piece of good fortune for all parties
concerned.</p>
<p>He proceeded to question Joe, desiring to learn all he could
of the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you had never seen the gentleman
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in your wife&rsquo;s album?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that he might be one of her old
beaux&mdash;no, not even there.&nbsp; He is a stranger to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if you met him you would know him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, rather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you describe him to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can do better&mdash;show you a picture of him just as
he leaves my front door.&rdquo;&nbsp; With that he <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>held out a
card, upon which was a round photograph, or rather picture, which
Eric saw had been taken with a Kodak camera, just coming into
general use at that time.</p>
<p>The scene was a door-step with a number over the door&mdash;a
man was descending&mdash;the lower part of his body could not be
seen, but his body and head were well taken.&nbsp; He carried
something under his arm like a flat book.</p>
<p>Eric Darrell studied the face as well as he could upon such a
small surface&mdash;he wanted to know it again.</p>
<p>Then he looked further.</p>
<p>Just above, a lady stood outside the door, as if seeing the
gentleman depart.&nbsp; It was Lillian Leslie without a
doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the deuce did you get this?&rdquo; he asked in
some surprise, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s as clever a piece of business as
I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hired a young fellow to do it for me.&nbsp; He took
this man several times afterward.&nbsp; See, there is one that
shows his face better, because there is little else&mdash;it was
taken close.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell examined this picture also.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me I&rsquo;ve seen this man on the street or
somewhere&mdash;I can&rsquo;t just place him though,&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>&ldquo;Is there anything more you wish to tell me,
Joe,&rdquo; he asked aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately&mdash;yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seemed as though fate had been pleased to conspire
against my peace of mind.&nbsp; I picked up a piece of paper from
the floor to toss into the grate in the library when certain
words caught my eye, and instead I put it in my
pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you the paper still?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see it, if you have no objection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&nbsp; I want everything to be placed
before you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything but your own secret,&rdquo; thought the
detective, as he took the paper.</p>
<p>It was evidently a portion of a torn note and had been twisted
around.</p>
<p>Darrell smoothed it flat and then read in a woman&rsquo;s fine
chirography:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&mdash;we will hope for the best.&nbsp; At
any rate, fair Lillian, your secret shall never be betrayed by
your sincere friend, <span class="smcap">Barbara</span>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;P.S.&nbsp; Be sure and burn this.&nbsp; B.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>&ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; asked
Joe.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has a peculiar look.&nbsp; One thing is
certain&mdash;Lillian made a mistake&mdash;she did not burn it
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tore it to pieces instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found it in your library?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a waste paper basket there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but we throw papers in the grate and when they
accumulate touch a match to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you might find the balance of this
letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the grate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately, one of the first things I did upon
arriving home yesterday evening was to apply a match to the
papers in the grate, and they have all been consumed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s hard luck, I take it, but men of my line
never cry over spilt milk.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the use?&nbsp; Now,
regarding this scrap&mdash;it is signed Barbara.&nbsp; Have you
any idea who the author is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, certainly&mdash;a young married lady who <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>lives back of
us.&nbsp; I have always entertained much respect for Mrs.
Goodwin, and am surprised to think she would enter into a
conspiracy with Lillian to deceive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective hardly knew what to think.</p>
<p>Here was a man whom he had known and considered a first-rate
fellow in the past, grieving over the fact that his wife was
keeping something from him, when, all the time, he was nursing a
secret within his guilty heart.</p>
<p>What was Darrell to make of it?</p>
<p>Those who live in glass houses should be careful how they
throw stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty hard, Joe, I admit, but when it comes
to secrets, who among us is above reproach?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe Leslie seems to color up in a manner altogether
unnecessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, for instance, old man&mdash;I warrant you do lots
of little things that you would hardly care for your wife to
know.&nbsp; But&rdquo;&mdash;seeing the other&rsquo;s evident
confusion&mdash;&ldquo;let that pass.&nbsp; I will undertake to
clear up this mystery for you, Joe, as speedily as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>&ldquo;Try and act as though your suspicions were not
aroused&mdash;do everything just as you would under ordinary
circumstances.&nbsp; Even treat this false friend Barbara
warmly&mdash;anything but to give our game away in the
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume I can go on in the same old rut, provided it
is not for long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll promise you that the whole thing will soon
be cleared up.&nbsp; There is a screw loose somewhere, and
I&rsquo;m going to find it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again Joe blushed at the emphasis laid on that word, though
Eric was not looking at him, and it did not seem as though he
meant any personal reflection.</p>
<p>A guilty conscience, Darrell concluded, needs no accuser, and
this man feels the finger of suspicion pointed at him, though he
cannot tell from whom it comes.</p>
<p>Used to reading human nature, the detective knows guilt when
he sees it.</p>
<p>Although he refrains from making any remark upon the subject,
he is in reality quite out o&pound; patience with his friend who
has thus early betrayed his trust&mdash;he could never have
believed it of Joe Leslie&mdash;he ought to be ashamed of
himself, doing anything to make such a sweet <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>woman
unhappy, and if it turns out to be so the detective is determined
that he shall eat the husks of remorse, drinking the bitter cup
to the very dregs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me keep these, Joe?&rdquo; holding up the pictures
and the scrap of paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, and I most earnestly pray they may be the
means of proving Lillian&rsquo;s innocence.&nbsp; My life will be
wrecked if she proves false.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not seem to think of what a position his own secret
action placed him in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will hope for the best, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever you discover must be a secret between myself
and you.&nbsp; I shall in my own way decide what must be
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell looked at his face while he spoke.&nbsp; He found
nothing vindictive there&mdash;instead, he saw a look of deep
pain.</p>
<p>To himself he thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had done anything wrong, I would like to be tried
by a judge like Joe Leslie&mdash;he would be merciful.&nbsp; If
his wife has erred, he is not the man to shoot her down&mdash;he
would fight like a tiger in her defense&mdash;but I believe under
such painful circumstances Joe would cry like a baby&mdash;and
forgive her.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 48</span>That
was his estimate of the man he had known so long&mdash;he forgot
just then that Joe was also under a cloud, and that there was
something in his life that needed the calcium light of an
investigation thrown upon it.</p>
<p>Thus the detective&rsquo;s opinion went up and down like a
shuttle-cock&mdash;he hardly knew how to take this good-natured
giant.</p>
<p>The latter was plainly ill at ease, and having said all he
desired, picked up his hat to go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure you won&rsquo;t smoke, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another wistful glance and a shake of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promised Lillian I would never smoke another cigar
until she gave me voluntary permission; and as she hates tobacco
smoke I presume I must keep my promise always.&nbsp; That is one
of the little penalties a man sometimes has to pay when he
captures a darling.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t have your pudding and
eat it too&mdash;so some of our bachelor freedom must
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the chains are golden ones, forged by love, and
if ever I meet a little woman like your wife, by Jove! I&rsquo;ll
be tempted to have her forge some.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk as though Lillian and you were old <a
name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>friends.&nbsp; You must meet her, Eric&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
be proud to have you know her&mdash;when this thing is
settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, my boy, I&rsquo;ll keep you to your
word.&nbsp; Perhaps she may have a sister, you see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has that, and very much like Lillian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Consider the thing fixed and invite me when her sister
is on from Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly will&mdash;what did I do with my
hat&mdash;ah, here it is on the desk&mdash;I will see you again
to-morrow, Eric&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ceased talking in the middle of a sentence, bent his head
down, for the light was gradually fading in the detective&rsquo;s
office, and then turning suddenly, said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&nbsp; Darrell, old man, where did you get
that&mdash;who&rsquo;s been writing down the number of my
Twenty-seventh Street house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell had forgotten to remove the paper upon which Lillian
had written the address, with her gloves on, and Joe Leslie now
held it in his hand.</p>

<p>If Joe Leslie recognized the writing as that of his wife, the
game was up.</p>
<p>He had no doubt had many letters from her during their
courtship days, and knew the style of the chirography well.</p>
<p>One thing favored Darrell.</p>
<p>Any one who has endeavored to write with gloves on will bear
witness to the fact that as a general rule they could not swear
to their own hand when cold.</p>
<p>So the chances were about ten to one that Joe could not
recognize the hand.</p>
<p>The detective was ready to accept the chances.&nbsp; He
maintained his cool demeanor through the emergency.</p>
<p>That was the result of education in his business.&nbsp;
Raising his eyebrows with an expression of surprise, he said:</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that house is yours,
friend Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective was looking for signs of suspicion about the
other.</p>
<p>Surprise and curiosity he plainly saw, but it was not so easy
to discover the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, now, what have you been looking up my house
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my honor, Joe, I&rsquo;ve never set eyes on the
building and don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s stone or brick,
three story or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what in the deuce&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience!&nbsp; Is your house in the market?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then perhaps it is one of a number given me by a real
estate agent to look up for a friend of mine.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
preserve the slip,&rdquo; taking it from Joe and folding it
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like a woman&rsquo;s writing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, all writing does after a man has fallen into the
habit of looking for letters day by day&mdash;letters that are
delayed&mdash;Come, you married men are very
suspicious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he dexterously whipped the subject around and began
talking about something <a name="page52"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 52</span>of decided interest, so that Joe,
completely hoodwinked, speedily forgot about the singular little
coincidence that had brought this address under the eyes of the
owner of the house.</p>
<p>He was not quite done with Joe yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must own a good deal of property in and around the
city, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do&mdash;property left to me by my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no need to work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps not.&nbsp; Some day when I take the
notion I mean to figure up my income from this property, and if
it&rsquo;s a good sum, by Jove! I&rsquo;ll fling business to the
winds and take my little wife to Europe for a year&mdash;that is,
if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell did not let him finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, man alive, you talk as though you didn&rsquo;t
hardly know what property you owned, yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I&mdash;it&rsquo;s all come to me since I
married, and I&rsquo;ve been so much taken up with my wife that I
haven&rsquo;t found time to attend to it as I should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell winked hard.</p>
<p>He knew certain facts that would seem to indicate that Joe
found time to spend an hour every afternoon with some one besides
Lillian.&nbsp; <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>If so then this was rank perjury.</p>
<p>What was he to think of a hypocrite?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jove! that&rsquo;s a queer case.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
suppose your wife has any idea of where your property
lies&mdash;never saw such places as this Twenty-seventh Street
house, for instance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens! no.&nbsp; That house is an eyesore to
me.&nbsp; The neighborhood is not a good one and I will only let
it to decent tenants.&nbsp; No, Lillian will never know I own a
house there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell was satisfied.</p>
<p>He had made his point.</p>
<p>Soon after Joe bade him good evening, and hurried away.</p>
<p>It was not far from five o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Darrell snatched a disguise from a hook and changed his
appearance in one minute.</p>
<p>All he wanted was to effect such a change that Joe might not
recognize him.</p>
<p>Then he left the office and bolted down stairs after his
friend.</p>
<p>Joe was discovered in the crowd, making his way toward the
elevated station, and knowing his destination Darrell arrived
there first.</p>
<p>They got in the same car.</p>
<p>At this time in the evening it was pretty crowded and both had
to stand up.</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>At
Twenty-seventh Street a number left the train and those we follow
with the rest.</p>
<p>Darrell observed Joe eagerly consult his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s late this evening and no doubt expects a
scolding,&rdquo; was his mental comment upon seeing the frown
upon Joe&rsquo;s usually good-natured face.</p>
<p>The giant walked along so fast that Eric could hardly keep his
place behind him.</p>
<p>They approached the fatal number.</p>
<p>Truly Joe acted like a guilty wretch&mdash;he glanced up and
down the street as if to make sure no acquaintance was
passing.</p>
<p>Deception was a novelty to him&mdash;this was the first time
Darrell had ever seen his friend acting in a mean role.</p>
<p>When they reached the steps Joe ascended them, took a key out
of his pocket and deliberately opened the front door.</p>
<p>The detective was passing at the time, but his quick glance
failed to reveal anything of interest.</p>
<p>Evening was coming on, and the shadows of the approaching
night had evidently gathered in the hall of the house&mdash;he
could just see the glass globe of the hanging gas jet in the
hall, but it was not lighted.</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>For
that matter there was no light about the house at all, though the
neighbors were beginning to illuminate their houses.</p>
<p>Passing down the street a little distance, Eric Darrell
crossed over, and came up the other side.</p>
<p>He now noticed that there was a light in the second story
front room, though almost ready to swear it had not been there
previous to the entrance of the proprietor.</p>
<p>The inside blinds were closed in such a way that Darrell could
see nothing.</p>
<p>He was deeply interested.</p>
<p>Whatever this strange mystery attached to Joe&rsquo;s daily
visit here might mean, Darrell could not forget that the other
was his friend.</p>
<p>He would act as a surgeon might when one whom he regarded
highly was brought before him for attention&mdash;his fingers
would be very tender, but the cruel knife must do its duty.</p>
<p>He was walking slowly along when he almost ran into a female
who stood on the edge of the pavement opposite the house.</p>
<p>Her black attire and the veil she wore attracted his attention
immediately.</p>
<p>Besides, she was looking upward toward the <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>windows where
the glimmer of light could be seen.</p>
<p>A suspicion flashed into his mind.</p>
<p>He touched the arm of the lady in black.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lillian&mdash;Mrs. Leslie,&rdquo; he said in a low
voice.&nbsp; A cry came from under the veil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who speaks to me?&rdquo; gasped the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is I&mdash;Eric Darrell.&nbsp; This is no place for
a lady, especially at such an hour.&nbsp; You may be insulted
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he is here&mdash;Joe, my husband, and where he is
his wife should not be afraid to go,&rdquo; she said with some
bitterness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Theoretically true, madam, but there are lots of places
in this wicked city where men daily pass and ladies dare not
go.&nbsp; You promised to leave this to me and you must keep your
word.&nbsp; Take my arm and let me see you to the elevated
station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She might have rebelled, but there was a touch of gentle but
firm authority in his tone, and being a woman she yielded,
knowing he was right.</p>
<p>On the way to the elevated station she was silent, but
finally, upon reaching the steps, she turned to her
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Darrell, does my husband know that I have sought
your advice?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>So
intensely interested was she in the answer, that she even held
her breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my knowledge, Mrs. Leslie, Joe does not even suspect
you of ever having seen me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven,&rdquo; she almost gasped, a world of
relief showing itself upon her face, for, the better to look at
her companion when expecting his answer, she had brushed her veil
aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not borrow trouble on that score.&nbsp; Act
naturally, as though you suspected nothing and had no reason to
evade his eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She moved uneasily at his words.</p>
<p>Darrell had spoken them with a purpose, just as the surgeon
probes for the bullet before making any attempt to extract
it.</p>
<p>He believed he had met with a certain share of success
too.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he want with you?&rdquo; she asked, as if to
cover her own confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merely a matter of business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he mention me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said I must come up and meet you
sometime&mdash;whatever this may turn out, Mrs. Leslie, I know
Joe fairly worships you&mdash;never doubt that fact.&nbsp; Some
things seem hard to put together, but when the truth shines upon
them they will be found very simple.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>&ldquo;Like Columbus and the egg, for
example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed.&nbsp; Now, if at any time you and I should
meet in Joe&rsquo;s presence, don&rsquo;t forget to treat me as a
stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall say good evening, and as a last word,
advise you to leave this to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall, Mr. Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She flitted up the station stairs and Darrell, with a long
sigh, turned down the street again.</p>
<p>Somehow the pretty wife of his friend quite fascinated him,
and he found himself wishing the sister would be like her.</p>
<p>Walking down the street, he soon reached his old stamping
ground.</p>
<p>The light burned in the second story room and he believed Joe
had not left the house.</p>
<p>For perhaps ten minutes things went on this way.</p>
<p>Then the light suddenly vanished.</p>
<p>A minute later Joe Leslie came out.</p>
<p>Darrell listened intently to see if he spoke to any one at the
door but a wagon rattling by prevented his making sure.</p>
<p>Then Joe descended the steps and set briskly off for the
elevated station.</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>The
detective did not follow him.</p>
<p>He desired to do a little work around that region, and knew
Joe was bound for home.</p>
<p>The house seemed to be dark and deserted, but others were in
the same condition, the shades being drawn and shutters
closed.</p>
<p>New York people, many of them, act as though their houses were
meant to be dungeons, being hermetically sealed to shut out the
light.</p>
<p>Darrell surveyed the building a few minutes, crossed over,
looked at it more closely, started up the steps, then shook his
head negatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet&mdash;I&rsquo;ll wait a little,&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>
<p>Glancing up and down the street he saw a small grocery store
on the corner.</p>
<p>People must eat, and these venders of daily provisions
generally know more about those who live in the neighborhood than
any other class.</p>
<p>The gossip and small talk of the street passes current here,
and the proprietor hears all.</p>
<p>So Darrell made for the grocery.</p>
<p>It was not a very extensive establishment&mdash;the owner and
his clerk were not busy, and Darrell, picking out the former,
asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you tell me who lives at No&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked at him with a smile.</p>
<p><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>&ldquo;A young woman named Mrs. Lester, whose husband I
believe is in California&mdash;she was in here once or
twice&mdash;quite a fine-looking lady,&rdquo; returned the
groceryman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; replied the detective, turning and
leaving the store as suddenly as he entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jacob, what number did he ask about?&rdquo; said the
proprietor, turning to his clerk.</p>
<p>The boy gave it, at which the other whistled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they call a bull on me.&nbsp; I was
five numbers out of the way.&nbsp; But let it pass.&nbsp; He
didn&rsquo;t want to buy nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blunder was destined to give Darrell trouble however.</p>
<h2><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE MAN DRESSED AS A BULL
FIGHTER</span></h2>
<p>When Eric Darrell left the little grocery on the corner, it
was with a bad feeling at his heart.</p>
<p>It seemed as though a cold, clammy hand had suddenly come in
contact with that member of his anatomy, and chilled it.</p>
<p>Could this thing be?</p>
<p>If Joe Leslie turned out to be that moral leper, a bigamist,
Darrell believed he would never put any trust in human nature
again.</p>
<p>Did it not look like it?</p>
<p>Nothing was lacking.</p>
<p>Good heavens! even the names were almost alike&mdash;Leslie
and Lester.</p>
<p>He was horrified&mdash;dazed&mdash;dumfounded.</p>
<p>Then his teeth came together with a snap, and he swore he
would solve this mystery&mdash;the man might be living two
lives&mdash;others had done it before&mdash;perhaps many in New
York are doing it to-day.</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>In his
time Darrell had met with just such cases as this, and he
believed his experience justified him in solving the puzzle.</p>
<p>So her husband was in California.</p>
<p>It was a likely story.</p>
<p>California must be very near by if he could drop in six times
a week.</p>
<p>He passed the house again and found that there were still no
signs of light.</p>
<p>Evidently those who lived there, perhaps enjoying the luxuries
of the season, knew how to hide their light under a bushel.</p>
<p>Darrell remembered what Joe had said&mdash;he had long since
despaired of renting the house, and probably did not try very
hard.</p>
<p>Then again about his income&mdash;no wonder he did not know
how he stood if he had to keep two separate establishments
running.</p>
<p>They might do that economically out in Salt Lake City among
the Mormons but it is quite an expensive luxury in New York.</p>
<p>So the detective made his way down to Twenty-third Street and
entering a dairy kitchen where a thousand were being served to
the music of an orchestra, had his dinner.</p>
<p>He took his time over it, read the evening <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>paper, and
when he finally passed out it was well on to eight
o&rsquo;clock.</p>
<p>Then he smoked a cigar and watched the passers by for half an
hour more.</p>
<p>Then he sauntered away.</p>
<p>At nine o&rsquo;clock he found himself one of a little crowd
gathered at the door of a hall.</p>
<p>A masquerade was to take place here, and as carriage after
carriage drove up, depositing nymphs and devils, cavaliers and
knights, upon the pavement, the crowd laughed in a good-natured
way.</p>
<p>Some of the rougher element might have indulged in jeers or
remarks that would have brought on trouble, but for their fear of
the law, which was represented by two stalwart policemen, armed
with their long night sticks which are a dread to the heathen of
the slums.</p>
<p>Darrell was interested too, and stood with the rest, looking
on.</p>
<p>While thus engaged, a gentleman and lady left a hack and
walked toward the entrance.</p>
<p>He represented a Spanish bull fighter, and with his splendid
figure made a remarkably good <i>matador</i>, while his
companion, as a lady of cards, caused a ripple of admiration
among the lookers-on.</p>
<p><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>Both
were fully masked, and, having wraps over their costumes, only a
portion of the latter were seen; but it was evident that the lady
was possessed of a lovely figure, her arms were rounded and
perfect, while her neck, glimpses of which could be seen, was
dazzlingly white, and royally built.</p>
<p>Darrell looked at her with interest.</p>
<p>Then his eyes fell on her escort.</p>
<p>He started.</p>
<p>Surely that figure was owned by none other than Joe
Leslie.</p>
<p>What was he doing at the ball?</p>
<p>Was this his wife?</p>
<p>Of course it must be&mdash;the figure and beautiful neck
corresponded with what Darrell remembered of Mrs. Leslie.</p>
<p>Still, he could not help but think it odd, even at that brief
moment, for Joe to bring his lovely wife here to this ball.</p>
<p>True, it was a respectable affair, and many good people
attended it, but none of the first families in New York would
dream of being seen at the public masquerade&mdash;at least if
they came they went away without unmasking.</p>
<p>As the couple passed him he could not resist saying aloud:</p>
<p><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>&ldquo;Hallo! Joe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man seemed to start, and muttered something to his
companion, at which she laughed, but he did not look around to
see who had spoken.</p>
<p>Others were following them.</p>
<p>Darrell stood a while longer, and then left the scene.</p>
<p>Somehow or other he was troubled&mdash;he knew not exactly
why.</p>
<p>If that was Lillian with her husband, it was all well and
good&mdash;although surprised at Joe taking his wife to such a
carnival, so long as her husband was with her it was all
right.</p>
<p>But was it Lillian?</p>
<p>This thought kept crowding into his brain.&nbsp; He could not
expel it.</p>
<p>After a little he became angry with himself for brooding over
the matter so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it, I can settle the matter easily,&rdquo; he
muttered, as he found himself at the foot of the stairs leading
to the elevated station.</p>
<p>So up he ran.</p>
<p>It was not a great while later when he found himself walking
along the street on which the Leslies lived.</p>
<p><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>He had
never seen their house before, but having the number speedily
found it.</p>
<p>Of course it was one of a row.&nbsp; How neat and clean
everything looked up in this region when compared with the
neighborhood of the Twenty-seventh Street house.</p>
<p>His sympathies naturally ran in favor of Lillian&mdash;he
seemed to believe she was the more innocent of Joe&rsquo;s
dupes&mdash;provided the case was really as bad as it seemed.</p>
<p>Making sure he had the right number, as the houses were built
pretty much alike, he ran up the steps and pulled the bell.</p>
<p>A minute later a girl came to the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish to
see Mr. Leslie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is out, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell&rsquo;s suspicions took firmer ground.</p>
<p>The girl held the door open a crack, as though it were secured
by a chain bolt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Leslie will do&mdash;can I see her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He almost held his breath waiting for the answer&mdash;it
seemed as though the fate of a seemingly happy household depended
upon it&mdash;whether Joe Leslie were saint or sinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Leslie is in&mdash;what name, please?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>&ldquo;You may say&mdash;stay, here is my card,&rdquo;
believing the girl would have no chance to read it on the
way.</p>
<p>He handed her a calling card which simply bore his name.</p>
<p>In a minute she came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Leslie will see you, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door opened.</p>
<p>Eric Darrell found himself under the roof of Joe
Leslie&rsquo;s little &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s nest,&rdquo; as the
latter was fond of styling it.</p>
<p>Everything around him showed evidences of good taste and
plenty of money.</p>
<p>Poor bachelor Eric heaved a sigh as he noted the comfortable
air of the cozy house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a fool,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;but some men
never know when they&rsquo;re well off.&nbsp; With a wife and a
home like his, Joe ought to be the happiest man in New
York.&nbsp; Seems to me these things generally go to the ones
least capable of appreciating them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the philosopher, in following the servant along
the hall, came to the open library door, through which she
motioned him to enter.</p>
<p>He did so.</p>
<p>Here his old bachelor soul was worse rattled <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>than
ever&mdash;such a dream of bliss may have come to him over his
post-prandial cigar, but he had never believed it could be
realized to a human being here below.</p>
<p>The soft lights, the cases of books, the cheery fire in the
large grate, and, chief of all, the pretty little lady seated at
the table engaged in some delicate fancy work&mdash;it all took
poor Eric&rsquo;s breath away.</p>
<p>He had sense enough to walk up and shake hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see the plight I am in&mdash;you will forgive my
not rising, Mr. Darrell,&rdquo; she said, referring to her lap
full of silk threads and such odds and ends.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, Mrs. Leslie, don&rsquo;t move, I beg.&nbsp;
I will find a seat near by,&rdquo; he returned.</p>
<p>She was looking at him eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Darrell, it is not accident that brings you up here
to-night?&rdquo; she said, and there was a question in her eyes
as well as in her voice.</p>
<p>He cannot get out of this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came on a little business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You asked to see Mr. Leslie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In reality I expected to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you have already solved our terrible <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>mystery&mdash;tell me the worst&mdash;does Joe visit
that awful house to play cards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is hard work dealing with a woman&mdash;she is apt to ask
so many questions and demand an answer&mdash;then, if important
facts are told her she may in a fit of pique or anger disclose
them to the very one who should not know.</p>
<p>Darrell knows all this.</p>
<p>He understands how to manage the gentler sex, and in the
present instance does not mean to tell one whit more than is
necessary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to say, Mrs. Leslie, that the case is not
yet closed&mdash;indeed, the complications are growing more
serious&mdash;but,&rdquo; as he observes the look of pain on her
sweet face, &ldquo;I expect and hope to soon clear it all
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven grant it,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>Luckily Lillian had considerable reserve force in her nature,
and now that this was brought into play, she gave promise of
rising to meet the exigencies of the occasion.</p>
<p>Darrell admired her courage.</p>
<p>He found it harder to believe evil of her than he did of Joe,
for he had great respect for the gentler sex, and believed all
men had a good share of the old Adam in them&mdash;some fought <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>the good
fight and conquered&mdash;others lay down their arms and
surrendered, while many ran to meet the evil half way, so
misshapen were their souls.</p>
<p>Alone, when speculating upon this strange double case, he
might figure out this thing or that by force of logic; but when
looking upon that truthful, lovely face, and into those calm
eyes, he was ready to exclaim:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame upon you, Eric Darrell, for ever even thinking
this little woman and wrong could have anything in common.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s an angel if ever there was one on earth, and I hope
her sister is built upon the same pattern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Joe?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t seen him then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;no, indeed, not to speak to since he was in my
office this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;thought he had gone to you&mdash;he spoke your
name in connection with the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What matter, may I ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sad affair that took him from me
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sad affair!</p>
<p>As Darrell saw again in imagination the gay surroundings of
the hall where the <a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>grand <i>bal masque</i> was being held, he ground his
teeth in silent rage, but knowing that a pair of sharp eyes were
upon him he did not allow his fury to find a vent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&nbsp; I am just as much in the dark as ever,
Mrs. Leslie&mdash;enlighten me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume it&rsquo;s the same sad business he went to
see you about to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell thought not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know he has a young clerk and cashier in his
employ, Georgie Kingsley, of whom Joe is very fond.&nbsp; Of late
he has been led to believe the boy is getting a little
wild&mdash;reports have been reaching Joe of little things,
showing that Georgie is keeping bad company, and gambling.&nbsp;
I know this has worried Joe of late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell thought something else might be giving him a nervous
spell too&mdash;no man can live a double life except at a great
mental strain, for the risk of sudden exposure must be
terrible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he&rsquo;s gone to try and save poor Georgie
to-night, has he?&nbsp; Noble-hearted old Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not help but catch something of the sneer under his
words, and trembled as she realized that the detective had grave
doubts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he would probably go to your room and get your
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>&ldquo;He changed his mind, no doubt,&rdquo; muttered
the detective&mdash;indignation was apt to make him tell more
than discretion warranted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean&mdash;you know something that you do
not want to tell me.&nbsp; I insist on your speaking.&nbsp; Have
you seen my husband?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entering the hall where a <i>bal masque</i> was being
held&mdash;quite a large affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alone?&rdquo; breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;with a lady.&nbsp; Good heavens!&nbsp; Mrs.
Leslie, take it calmly, I beg of you!&rdquo;</p>

<span class="GutSmall">MARIAN</span></h2>
<p>He need not have been so alarmed.</p>
<p>True, the blood seemed to leave Lillian&rsquo;s face, and she
gasped for breath, but a moment later she appeared so calm that
even the detective was amazed.</p>
<p>His admiration increased, for he saw this woman was no pretty
doll, to faint at the first breath of adversity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know this as a fact, Mr. Darrell?&rdquo; she
asked in steady tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, positively, and I think we ought to give Joe
the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall do more than that.&nbsp; Until with his own
lips he acknowledges such a thing to me, I will believe him
innocent&mdash;I will trust him as I have always done, as the
best and truest man on earth.&nbsp; And yet it cuts home to even
have such suspicions aroused&mdash;oh, if Marian were only
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>&ldquo;Your sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the sister I love so dearly, and who would be such
a comfort to me.&nbsp; She always believed in Joe.&nbsp; It would
be a great shock to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric was struck by a sudden thought.</p>
<p>They always came with a rush, and at times might fall under
the name of an inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you your sister&rsquo;s photograph handy, Mrs.
Leslie?&nbsp; Your husband spoke of her so much and said I must
meet her some day.&nbsp; I am quite interested, and would like to
see her picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is it on the mantel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She did not evidently suspect the awful thought that came into
his brain.</p>
<p>He walked over and looked at the photograph.&nbsp; It
attracted him very much.</p>
<p>The face was very like Lillian&rsquo;s, only the hair and eyes
were dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall expect an invitation here when your sister
comes on, Mrs. Leslie.&nbsp; She is in Chicago now, I
believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is her home, but she is now traveling in
California with a party of friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>California!</p>
<p><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>The
mention of that far-away State sent a cold chill down his
back.</p>
<p>Was it not the grocery man who had said the beautiful Mrs.
Lester&rsquo;s husband was in California?</p>
<p>Somehow he made the application, and the effect was a decided
chill.</p>
<p>It was growing blacker for Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall take a run down and see if I can find
Joe&mdash;he may be at my room waiting for me&mdash;who
knows?&nbsp; Can I trust you to keep this matter from him, Mrs.
Leslie&mdash;supposing this is all a mistake and that he is
innocent, would you ever want him to believe that you harbored
such suspicions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I would not,&rdquo; she sobbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then do your part&mdash;you can act it I am sure.&nbsp;
Appear natural&mdash;show no unusual coldness or warmth of
affection&mdash;try not to meet his eye or your own may betray
you.&nbsp; If he insists on finding out what ails you, retreat in
the usual plea of a headache.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not fail you, Mr. Darrell.&nbsp; You go about
your work with the prayers of a faithful wife following
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He believed it then&mdash;he would have staked <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>his life on
her truth&mdash;and yet in the near future such terrible doubts
were to arise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely that talisman ought to keep any man who is half
a man, from evil&mdash;a loving mother and a faithful wife are
the lodestones that have saved many a weak man from the pit of
destruction.&nbsp; Good-night, Mrs. Leslie.&nbsp; Remember,
should the worst come, you can depend upon Eric Darrell as your
brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had said more than he intended to, but he was not
cold-blooded like a fish, and the evident distress of this angel
on earth had wrought up all his feelings.</p>
<p>Just then he felt as though he could have pommeled Joe Leslie
with the greatest of pleasure.</p>
<p>Any man was a brute who would give a woman like this sweet
creature, pain.</p>
<p>So Eric strode away angry with the wickedness of the world in
general, and this friend of his in particular.</p>
<p>If Joe Leslie turned out a rascal he could see no palliating
circumstance connected with the case, and according to his ideas
the man ought to be drawn and quartered.</p>
<p>Hardly knowing where he was going, Darrell <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>brought up at
the hall where the <i>bal masque</i> was in progress.</p>
<p>It was still early&mdash;not later than half past ten, and the
affair had only started.</p>
<p>Any one could get in on payment of the regular price, two
dollars, although none were allowed on the main floor but
masks.</p>
<p>Darrell went in.</p>
<p>He had seen these things before, and hence had little interest
in the ball itself.</p>
<p>Most of the characters were old too, although here and there
some genius had devised something new, and worth looking at.</p>
<p>Eric had other ideas in view.</p>
<p>Monks, flower girls, Indians, Chinese, knights, fortune
tellers, dames and the endless chain of historical personages
such an event gathers, passed before him without exciting more
than a slight smile or a single glance of admiration.</p>
<p>He was looking for the couple upon whom he meant to bestow his
interest.</p>
<p>Soon he sighted them.</p>
<p>From that time on Eric seldom took his eyes off the pair.</p>
<p>He imagined he detected certain little peculiarities in the
man&rsquo;s walk that marked him as Joe Leslie.</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>As for
the woman, Eric became quite interested trying to make her
out&mdash;in figure she certainly resembled Lillian, and this
only added to his eager pursuit.</p>
<p>Another point he noticed&mdash;her hair was dark.</p>
<p>Was she the one who had entered his mind?</p>
<p>He noticed that when they danced it was always
together&mdash;other couples might separate but the Spanish bull
fighter and the Lady of Cards seemed inseparable.</p>
<p>Probably they were greeted with more or less lively sallies in
the badinage that passed current among the dancers, but the size
of the bull fighter deterred any envious swains from attempting
to relieve him of his partner.</p>
<p>Darrell noted the envious actions of some of the male maskers
who could not find partners, and made up his mind there would be
trouble yet unless the couple withdrew early.</p>
<p>The detective had managed to get below by bribing a
keeper.</p>
<p>He did not go out upon the floor, but remained under the
gallery.</p>
<p>It was not very light here.</p>
<p>Now and then some promenading couple would pass by, chatting
and laughing, a red clad <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>Mephistopheles fanning a pretty
shepherdess, or a portly friar joking with Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>One thing is always noticeable about these <i>bal
masques</i>&mdash;the ladies never assume a grotesque costume,
always endeavoring to appear charming, according to their own
ideas, and leaving the funny part of the business to the male
sex.</p>
<p>The couple whom Darrell was anxious to watch had mingled with
the crowd dancing and for some little time he lost sight of
them.</p>
<p>He began to grow a little anxious and was just thinking of
changing his quarters, when all of a sudden they appeared in view
close by.</p>
<p>They were heading for the dark spot under the gallery where,
only a few persons had gathered.</p>
<p>The lady was holding both hands up to her head, as if to keep
her, mask from falling while her tall escort forced a
passage.</p>
<p>Eric shrank back behind a pillar.</p>
<p>The two came within ten feet of where he stood, and there
halted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you fix it?&rdquo; he heard her ask.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try, Marian,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>
<p>That name&mdash;it confirmed the detective&rsquo;s worst
fears&mdash;he could believe anything now.&nbsp; The Lady of
Cards handed her mask to her <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>companion, who immediately endeavored
to refasten the string that had broken loose.</p>
<p>Meanwhile she stood with her face bared, looking out upon the
throng.</p>
<p>What a miserable thing it was that the light was so poor under
the gallery.</p>
<p>Darrell just then would have given a hundred dollars for one
good square look at her face.</p>
<p>Oh, for an electric torch to suddenly light up the scene and
reveal those features to his gaze.</p>
<p>He used his eyes to the utmost, but it was not at all
satisfactory, for her face was in the shadow; but he had an idea
she was very like the picture he had looked at recently&mdash;the
photograph of Lillian&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>Presently the bull fighter had succeeded in re-securing the
string.</p>
<p>He tied the mask on for her.</p>
<p>His manner was very courtly and gentle, but one spectator did
not enjoy it at all.</p>
<p>This was Eric.</p>
<p>His thoughts would go, in spite of him, to that heavenly room
where he had left a sweet and faithful wife waiting for her Joe
to return.</p>
<p>Somehow Eric felt savage to-night, and he wondered whether it
would not serve this man <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>just right if he did get into trouble
with some of the envious young beaux who followed him about as
though only waiting a good chance to carry off his partner by
force.</p>
<p>A traitor deserved such punishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never believe in a man again,&rdquo; said
Eric to himself, filled with shame and disgust for his sex;
&ldquo;by Jove! they&rsquo;re all alike, a miserable crowd of
deceivers, every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He forgot that he belonged to the same sex, and that his very
indignation proved his words exaggerated, since he could not
share in such evil plottings, and there must be others like
him.</p>
<p>He wandered up and down.</p>
<p>Now and then he saw the couple, but much of the time they were
lost to his view.</p>
<p>Darrell remained near the exit.</p>
<p>It was nearly twelve o&rsquo;clock, when the order to unmask
would be given.</p>
<p>Some who did not care to remain and be recognized were already
flitting.</p>
<p>He believed those whom he watched would do likewise, and it
was his desire to get outside at the same time to hear the
directions given to the driver if any were uttered.</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>Just at
this moment, close by, he heard sounds of an uproar.</p>
<p>These things are generally prevented at public balls by the
presence of the police, but no officers were in sight
now&mdash;perhaps they had gone into the refreshment room.</p>
<p>Darrell instantly had a suspicion of the truth, and his eyes
were immediately directed toward the <i>melee</i>.</p>
<p>Just as he suspected, in the struggling crowd he saw the tall
form of the Spanish bull fighter&mdash;the man was dealing blows
right and left and had already sent several audacious assailants
rolling in the dust of the hall floor.</p>
<h2><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A BRAND FROM THE BURNING</span></h2>
<p>The detective was a man.</p>
<p>He admired courage and grit, no matter in whom it was found,
and when he saw the Spanish bull fighter holding his own against
the number who had assailed him he could not but express this
feeling.</p>
<p>It seemed as though these young bloods were furious because
the other kept his partner to himself, and allowed her to dance
with no one else&mdash;it is always the case that a pack of such
hot heads may be found at a public gathering, and trouble often
ensues.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Lady of Cards, secure behind her mask, had flirted
with some of them, and had driven them wild.</p>
<p>It is human nature to covet what we cannot have and their
anger toward the giant bull fighter had grown intense.</p>
<p><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>As we
have seen, it culminated in what threatened to be a riot.</p>
<p>The woman was frightened now&mdash;she trembled, and cowered
behind her protector.</p>
<p>He stood up like a rock before her.</p>
<p>Twice his arm had shot out and on each occasion one of his
assailants had gone down.&nbsp; They pressed him hard.</p>
<p>The bull fighter turned to the right and left and defended
himself gallantly, while he shielded his companion as best he
could.</p>
<p>It was a singular spectacle to be seen at a New York public
ball.</p>
<p>When passion rules men&rsquo;s minds their surroundings have
no effect on them.</p>
<p>They would fight in a tomb, over the dead.</p>
<p>Seeing that in all probability the rascals would get the
better of the man, Darrell pushed that way; at this moment one of
the men grasped the lady by the wrist.</p>
<p>She screamed.</p>
<p>The bull fighter turned like a mad tiger, saw what was
transpiring, threw the assailants who were clinging to him, and
plunged at the man who was grasping the lady&rsquo;s arm and
endeavoring to drag her away, for the music still kept <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>up, and many
were dancing all unconscious of the <i>melee</i>.</p>
<p>There was a tremendous rush, the bull fighter caught the
wretch and whirled him, spinning like a teetotum, ten feet
away.&nbsp; Never did a dancing dervish spin so merrily.</p>
<p>Then came an awful crash, as the man struck a swaying column
of dancers, who immediately toppled over upon him.</p>
<p>By this time the detective was at the side of the bull
fighter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep back, you young fools!&nbsp; Keep back, I say, or
I&rsquo;ll land the whole of you in the Tombs!&rdquo;&nbsp; His
words were heard.</p>
<p>Backed up as they were with the shining barrel of a revolver,
they commanded respect.</p>
<p>By this time the management had succeeded in getting the
officers from the supper-room to the spot, and upon seeing them
come, the young fellows who had been the cause of the disturbance
slunk away, losing themselves in the crowd.</p>
<p>The management apologized to the bull fighter when they
learned what had occurred, but his companion seemed to have
received a nervous shock&mdash;at any rate they retired for their
wraps.</p>
<p><a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>Darrell
moved outside.</p>
<p>There was something more he desired to learn and the chance
must soon come.</p>
<p>He waited.</p>
<p>Just at twelve they came.</p>
<p>The hour for unmasking had arrived, and there was quite a high
time within.</p>
<p>This displeased the detective, for he was afraid lest he might
not hear what he desired.</p>
<p>The couple walked down the pavement in search of the carriage,
which was waiting near by, the driver having received
instructions.</p>
<p>They soon reached it.</p>
<p>Darrell hovered near.</p>
<p>The bull fighter assisted his companion in and then entered
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to, sir?&rdquo; asked the driver, probably not
knowing but what they had another engagement at some private
ball.</p>
<p>A burst of laughter from the house deadened the reply, but
Darrell&rsquo;s keen ears caught:&ldquo;&mdash;Twenty-seventh
Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was enough.</p>
<p>He felt down-spirited.</p>
<p>In so far as he could see ahead, the case was a settled
one&mdash;Joe Leslie was guilty.</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>He
seemed to feel it as keenly as though it were a brother of
his.</p>
<p>Poor Lillian! that it should come to this in one short
year.</p>
<p>It would have seemed incredible, but he was used to meeting
with strange things, and being of a philosophical train of mind
could take things pretty much as they came.</p>
<p>So Darrell turned homeward.</p>
<p>There was nothing more to be done that night.</p>
<p>He remembered that on the morning he had engaged to watch the
house in which the Leslies lived.</p>
<p>That strange man would come and must be tracked to discover
his identity.</p>
<p>It was a task Darrell did not like.</p>
<p>Every time he thought of it he saw the face of Lillian before
him, and in the depth of those liquid eyes there appeared such a
world of truth that the detective was fain to shake his head.</p>
<p>Experienced man of the world as he was, he could not believe
her guilty.</p>
<p>There must be some mistake.</p>
<p>So he made his way to his rooms, feeling depressed over the
events of the night.</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>He
hated the thought of his next meeting with the lady&mdash;how
could he face her and tell her what he had seen and heard?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang the foolish fellow&mdash;how could he treat such
an angel in that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hold on, Mr. Darrell, before twenty-four hours have flown you
will perhaps have changed your mind and concluded that even
angels may be of the earth, earthy.</p>
<p>When he arrived at his apartments it was about half-past
twelve.</p>
<p>As he opened the door he saw a card below.&nbsp; When he had
applied the burning match to the gas, he picked this up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; was his exclamation.</p>
<p>His eyes had fallen upon a name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joseph Gregory Leslie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning the card over he found, scribbled in pencil, the
words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Called to see you&mdash;may come in later
to-night.&nbsp; Some important business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he had read this the detective scratched his head and
mused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is this&mdash;he must have run down here
first.&nbsp; Come in later, eh?&nbsp; Well, who knows but what
after he has seen <i>Marian</i> home he may run down?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>He
stopped to listen to a carriage rumbling along the
street&mdash;at this time of night they were not very frequent
here, and when it stopped in front of the house he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, he has seen her home and come down to carry out his
promise to Lillian.&nbsp; The story of the erring clerk may not
be all moonshine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put his head out of the window.</p>
<p>The carriage lamps shone below.</p>
<p>It was a hack, drawn by dark horses.</p>
<p>So had the other been.</p>
<p>Darrell had not the slightest idea but that they were one and
the same&mdash;he flattered himself that he could read Joe Leslie
like a book, for the man was a poor plotter.</p>
<p>Just as he suspected, there were footsteps on the stairs.</p>
<p>Some one was coming.</p>
<p>A knock sounded on his door.</p>
<p>Opening it, who should be standing there but Joe Leslie in the
flesh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are home at last&mdash;I have been here twice
before and found you out,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Darrell believed once would answer, but of course he made no
such remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, come in and sit down.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo; asked Darrell, just as
though he did not already know.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you give me an hour or so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a favorite clerk&mdash;I am afraid he has fallen
into bad company.&nbsp; For his mother&rsquo;s sake I want to
rescue him before it is too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell admired the motive however much he distrusted the
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute and I will go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kicked off his slippers and drew on his shoes.&nbsp; Then a
coat and hat followed.&nbsp; The minute was not yet over when he
announced himself in readiness.</p>
<p>Truly, Eric Darrell would do for a lightning change artist on
the stage.</p>
<p>They passed down the stairs of the house, which had apartments
for gentlemen only.</p>
<p>New York is full of these bachelor dens, some of them having
suites of rooms furnished in a gorgeous manner that speaks of the
sybarite taste of the rich young or old owner.&nbsp; The
bachelors of to-day live for their own comfort, surrounded by all
the luxuries money can purchase for them.</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>No one
thinks of pitying them any longer, least of all do they
themselves feel forlorn.</p>
<p>People who love a home may sigh at such a picture, but it is
the truth in all large cities and New York above the rest.&nbsp;
On the way down Joe spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know the places where such a young man is apt to be
found, Eric?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I ought to&mdash;my business carries me into them
every week,&rdquo; replied the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us make the rounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke wearily.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>When a man has been dancing for several hours, he cannot feel
as fresh as a daisy&mdash;it does not stand to reason.</p>
<p>They entered the hack.</p>
<p>Darrell gave his first address to Joe who repeated it to the
driver.</p>
<p>Away they went.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello! what&rsquo;s wrong with your hand?&rdquo; asked
the detective.&nbsp; The carriage lamps gave enough light for him
to see that Joe had his handkerchief wrapped around the knuckles
of his right hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Took a tumble up a dark flight of stairs <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>when I was
looking awhile back and bruised my knuckles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell smiled but made no remark.&nbsp; He thought he knew
how that hand had become bruised&mdash;it was in a more honorable
business than falling up stairs&mdash;in defending a weak and
helpless woman against ruffians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know some of these places then, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My driver knew of several, but I had hard work getting
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell thought so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps they did not think I wanted to play, and may
have been suspicious of my intentions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt.&nbsp; If you rescued some young fellow from
their clutches, it meant less money for their pockets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>Soon the vehicle stopped.</p>
<p>They entered a gambling den.</p>
<p>Joe quickly declared his clerk was not there and they
proceeded to another.</p>
<p>Four had been visited, and in the last one he discovered the
young man at the green baize, his face flushed with wine and
excitement.</p>
<p>The detective drew him out and brought him to his employer, at
sight of whom he turned white and put his hands to his eyes.</p>
<p><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>Joe
Leslie talked to him beautifully&mdash;even that hard-hearted
detective, Eric Darrell, who had seen so much of the world, had
to turn his head away and wink hard to dry up his tears.</p>
<p>As for the boy&mdash;he was hardly more&mdash;what he heard so
affected him that he caught hold of Joe&rsquo;s arm and sobbed
outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As heaven is my judge, Mr. Leslie, from this hour I
will never again yield to temptation in any shape.&nbsp; What you
said about my mother has taken the scales from my eyes and I
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even Darrell knew he would stand firm.</p>
<p>Joe Leslie had saved one soul.</p>
<h2><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE JEHU ADDS TO THE MYSTERY</span></h2>
<p>It gave Eric Darrell a strange feeling to hear Joe talk in the
vein he did.</p>
<p>Of all men on earth&mdash;or women either&mdash;he despised a
hypocrite.</p>
<p>Could he believe Joe sincere in what he said about deceit,
when such a load of suspicion was resting over his own head?</p>
<p>Eric was badly rattled.</p>
<p>He believed and yet doubted.</p>
<p>Something must soon come up to decide the question one way or
another.</p>
<p>On the way to his rooms, where Joe was to put him down, the
latter fell asleep in the corner, so no words passed between
them.</p>
<p>When the hack came to a stop Joe woke up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hello
here, where are we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At my den;&rdquo; and Eric got out as the driver opened
the door.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>&ldquo;Then I can have another nap before I reach my
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to-morrow morning, Eric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t, you may depend upon it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a sudden thought flashed through his mind he turned and
looked at the driver.</p>
<p>Surely this was not the same man who had driven Joe from the
<i>bal masque</i>.</p>
<p>The detective did not remember the number of the other
vehicle, but had seen the man&mdash;both wore the regulation tall
stove-pipe hat, without which no cabby is ever seen in New York,
if he has any respect for himself, but there was a decided
difference in the height of the men.</p>
<p>This again puzzled Eric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name, driver?&rdquo; he asked, as the
other was about to mount his box.</p>
<p>&ldquo;John Mulligan, sor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;German, of course?&rdquo; smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yis, sor, direct from Cork.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where can you be found in the morning about ten
o&rsquo;clock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man gave his stand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then consider yourself engaged by myself from ten to
twelve, and wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>&ldquo;All right, sor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hack rattled down the street.</p>
<p>Darrell looked after it and shook his head&mdash;he did not
know really what to think.</p>
<p>In all the strange cases he had handled in the past, he could
not remember one which had presented such a confusing front as
this.</p>
<p>It faced both ways.</p>
<p>He was not yet ready to believe either side until stronger
proofs were presented.</p>
<p>At any rate another day would surely develop new features
bearing on the case, and from these he would be able to get
conclusions.</p>
<p>He retired at a quarter to three.</p>
<p>It was his intention to rise at eight, and when he jumped out
of bed the clock lacked but a few minutes of the hour.</p>
<p>Before nine he had breakfasted in a neighboring cafe.</p>
<p>The other inmates of the bachelor apartment house had no idea
of the occupation the detective followed.</p>
<p>He was a quiet fellow and did not seek
acquaintances&mdash;besides, in New York, people get acquainted
only through regular channels&mdash;two families might live next
door for several years <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>and their ways and hours are so
different that the members hardly know their neighbors by
sight.</p>
<p>It was now getting on toward the time when he ought to be up
town.</p>
<p>He ran down to his office first, and blossomed out as a
first-class masher, of the type who frequent the
matinees&mdash;real lady killers.</p>
<p>Then he next made his way up town on the elevated road, and
got off at Eighty-ninth Street.</p>
<p>In a short time he was in the drug store near the home of the
Leslies.</p>
<p>The proprietor was talkative and friendly.</p>
<p>It was just three minutes of ten when a gentleman passed along
the pavement in the direction of the house under
surveillance.</p>
<p>He turned and came into the drug store ostensibly to buy a
cigar, but in reality, as the detective guessed, to pass the
time.</p>
<p>Just as the clock was about striking he hurried out and was
soon mounting the steps leading to the Leslie mansion.</p>
<p>Eric shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no accounting for tastes,&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; laughed the druggist, &ldquo;he picked out
the poorest weed in the box.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>But
Darrell was thinking of something else.&nbsp; He had in mind the
stalwart figure and pleasing face of Joe Leslie.</p>
<p>Between the two he saw no choice.</p>
<p>Still, this man was in a way distinguished by his poetical
appearance&mdash;his face was smooth, all but a wavy mustache,
and he wore his hair down upon his shoulders.</p>
<p>Eric spent some time talking to the druggist, but he kept
watch upon the Leslie domicile.&nbsp; At eleven the stranger came
out.&nbsp; He was given egress by Mrs. Leslie, and Darrell was
put in mind of the photograph Joe had shown him.</p>
<p>His business now was to discover who this gentleman was.</p>
<p>He followed him to the elevated railroad, and went in the car
next to that which the man under surveillance entered.</p>
<p>Thus, at about eleven twenty-three, he followed the other
along Twenty-third Street and saw him enter a certain building
among the handsome stores.</p>
<p>Still pursuing his man, carefully keeping him under his eye,
he watched until the other had entered a room on the top
floor.</p>
<p>There was a door-plate in sight.</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>Going
closer the detective read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul Prescott&mdash;Artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He knew the name&mdash;the owner had quite a reputation as a
painter, but Eric had never as yet heard of him as a lady
killer.</p>
<p>His next work was to get some information concerning Mr.
Prescott.</p>
<p>There were other offices below, and entering one which seemed
to be that of an ivory carver, he introduced the subject by
saying that he had occasion to make use of an artist at his home,
and wished to make certain inquiries concerning the gentleman
above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not like to say anything,&rdquo; remarked the
ivory carver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not going to ask about his
work&mdash;that stands on its own merits&mdash;but as he would
have to be a member of my family for a time if he undertook the
job, I would like to know if he is a perfect
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no occasion to believe otherwise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;N&mdash;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to hesitate&mdash;am I to infer that you have
any reason to believe otherwise?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to think he was, but of late he told me he was a
widower.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it.&nbsp; I suppose he has lots
of people visit his studio?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a number.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ladies particularly&mdash;he&rsquo;s very fond of the
gentle sex, and they quite make a hero of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell smiled.</p>
<p>He had seen stage favorites whom the silly women of New York
were wont to rave over, and knew just how foolishly they could
act.</p>
<p>Thank heaven all women are not alike, and yet their weak
points are more or less developed in the whole sex, as with
men.</p>
<p>He sighed as he thought of it, and then he turned again, loyal
to the resolve he had made not to condemn Lillian without the
most absolute proof.</p>
<p>As he left the building he remembered the hack driver.</p>
<p>Could he reach his stand before twelve?</p>
<p>He started off&mdash;a street car assisted him up Sixth
Avenue, and he arrived just five minutes before the noon
hour.</p>
<p>John was there.</p>
<p>He had the same horses as on the previous night, and showed no
marks of his late hours.</p>
<p><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>At
sight of the detective he made no sign of recognition, which was
quite natural, for the latter&rsquo;s disguise was complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, John, I want your vehicle,&rdquo; Eric said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m engaged just now, sor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, warming your heels.&nbsp; John, I&rsquo;m the
gentleman who engaged you last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man made a peculiar face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell that till the marines, sor.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t I
got eyes&mdash;phat good are they if I don&rsquo;t
see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, they&rsquo;re no good if they can&rsquo;t see
that&mdash;five dollars, pay for the two hours you&rsquo;ve
waited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked at the bill and took it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Faith
an&rsquo; now I know ye&rsquo;re the gentlemon,&rdquo; he said
with a leer.</p>
<p>It is strange yet true that such a man can always see better
with a bank bill over his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did my friend Leslie
get home all right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anybody waiting up for him?&rdquo; carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His wife I reckon, sor&mdash;leastways she let him in
directly the kerriage stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a point for the detective.</p>
<p>He made a note of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you driven for Mr. Leslie before?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>&ldquo;Several times, sor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where yees are correct&mdash;he&rsquo;s a
man I could do lots for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not flattery&mdash;the true ring could be detected in
such praise&mdash;it came from the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did it come he had another driver earlier in the
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him&mdash;Mr. Joseph Leslie&mdash;sure I took him from
his house and brought him back and divil another driver did he
have at all.&nbsp; Phat are yees drivin&rsquo; at?&nbsp; I
dunno!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made a mistake, John&mdash;I see it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To himself, however, this hunter of men was saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably Joe has bought this fellow up, body and
soul&mdash;that would account for his desire to serve
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nothing could be more easily done, for the man looked like one
who would be faithful.</p>
<p>If this were the case it would be love&rsquo;s labor lost to
attempt to get any intelligence out of such a man.</p>
<p>Still, Eric Darrell prided himself on his manner of cross
questioning, and he began to work the jehu in a manner that was
novel to say the least.</p>
<p><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>Thus
he found that to all appearances John had driven down town, and
taken the gentleman to several places besides the apartment house
where he held forth.</p>
<p>Altogether they had visited three houses where games of chance
were going on but there was so much trouble effecting an entrance
to these places that it had consumed much time.</p>
<p>If this were true it would make the puzzle darker than
ever.</p>
<p>The question was, could John be trusted?</p>
<p>He had to watch the man keenly in order to read him at
all.</p>
<p>An Irishman can dissemble about as well as the next one, and
this jehu was a particularly bright boy, from the &ldquo;ould
dart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you meet any one you knew about a quarter of
twelve?&rdquo; asked the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I&mdash;yes, it was just striking the midnight hour
when I spoke to Mike Crotty, the night police at the corner av
Broadway and Worth Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know him&mdash;what remarks passed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We both spoke av the bells&mdash;and Mike towld me
about a dancing in the moonlight he saw wanst in ould Ireland,
when the fairies came out <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>to howld their only ball&mdash;it
was at this hour he seen it and lost his mind.&nbsp; Whin he
found it again the beastly work had stopped and the fairies were
gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess it&rsquo;s too late for me to do what I
meant to.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t need you to-day, John.&nbsp;
Sometime I may want your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words Eric Darrell coolly turned and walked
away.&nbsp; The Irishman looked after him quizzically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s an odd genius, but, d&rsquo;ye know, I
rather like the man.&nbsp; Just as if I don&rsquo;t know where
he&rsquo;s gone.&nbsp; Hope he finds Mike Crotty on deck this
fine day.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">JOE&rsquo;S SECRET</span></h2>
<p>Mike Crotty was on deck.&nbsp; Eric readily found him.</p>
<p>The man was a stranger to him, but there is a mystic tie
between the detectives and police in a great city&mdash;they work
in harmony.</p>
<p>Soon the two men were conversing with the greatest
freedom.</p>
<p>Crotty had often heard of Detective Darrell, and was only too
glad to supply any information that lay in his power.&nbsp; He
remembered meeting the hackman and spoke of the bells ringing out
the midnight hour.</p>
<p>There could be no mistake.</p>
<p>When Eric left the officer, he was a badly puzzled man to be
sure.&nbsp; Instead of having solved the mystery it was assuming
even darker proportions, and the chances seemed equally
divided.</p>
<p>Was Joe guilty or not?</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>If,
as these men agreed, he was at a certain place just as the solemn
midnight hour rang out, how could he have been at the <i>bal
masque</i>&mdash;it was at that hour of unmasking the Spanish
bull fighter and his consort, the Lady of Cards, drove away in
another vehicle and yet&mdash;that man possessed the stalwart
figure of Joe Leslie&mdash;Eric believed he would know it
anywhere&mdash;he had answered to the name of Joe, while his
companion was Marian.</p>
<p>The difficulties in the way might have daunted a less
persevering officer than Darrell.</p>
<p>They only spurred him on to renewed exertions.&nbsp; He
gloried in a puzzle.</p>
<p>To a man of his nature it was the most pleasurable work in the
world, studying the intricacies of a mystery, grasping a thread
in the labyrinthine maze, following it along inch by inch, until
the whole thing resolved itself into a solved problem.</p>
<p>Then, when the end came, how proud he would be to survey his
work.</p>
<p>He began to give Joe the benefit of the doubt.&nbsp; This was
one point gained.</p>
<p>It is a rule in American courts never to adjudge a man guilty
until he has been <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>proven so&mdash;the law looks upon him as innocent, and
all efforts of the prosecutor are directed toward proving the
charges.</p>
<p>In some other countries the opposite is the case and the
accused has to prove his innocence.</p>
<p>Eric Darrell was gradually applying this former principle to
the case in question.</p>
<p>Perhaps Joe might be innocent, and this cloud hanging over him
be the result of circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>At any rate the detective hoped so.</p>
<p>He looked at his watch mechanically.</p>
<p>Just now the thought came into his head that he must find out
all about Joe before another night had spread its mantle over the
city.</p>
<p>The time dragged along.</p>
<p>He had some work to do in his office, and this consumed
something like an hour.</p>
<p>Then he made his way slowly in the direction of Twenty-seventh
Street.</p>
<p>It was about four when he came in sight of the house around
which clustered so much that was mysterious.</p>
<p>Sauntering along, he kept watch for Joe, feeling almost sure
the other would come.</p>
<p>Sure enough, at the regular time his tall figure came in
view.</p>
<p><a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>Darrell managed it so that at this moment he was nearly
opposite the house.</p>
<p>He could see Joe without looking in a particular manner across
the street, and he saw that the other appeared nervous and
worried.</p>
<p>Was his guilty secret wearing on his mind?</p>
<p>Something undoubtedly disturbed him.</p>
<p>Any one could see that from the expression on his face.</p>
<p>As usual, when he came in front of the house, he turned and
looked up the street, as though he were afraid lest some one whom
he knew would recognize him.</p>
<p>Then he went up the steps.</p>
<p>There was no ringing the bell.</p>
<p>With a key he opened the door as though proprietor there.</p>
<p>Then Darrell, passing on, lost sight of him.&nbsp; The
detective crossed the street beyond, and came on down, intending
to pass the house again.</p>
<p>He changed his mind.</p>
<p>When just opposite, looking up he saw that fortune beckoned
him.</p>
<p>The door was ajar.</p>
<p>Joe had been a trifle careless, and made a mistake when he
thought he closed the door.</p>
<p><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>What
could be better?</p>
<p>Mr. Darrell was a man quick to make up his mind, and he
instantly saw a chance here to further his plans.</p>
<p>Without hesitating an instant he advanced up the steps, stood
upon the door-step, and seemed to glance around carelessly, when
in reality he was listening to catch any sound that might come
from the interior.</p>
<p>Another moment and he had entered.</p>
<p>Perhaps some one saw him, but he had put on an air of
proprietorship such as Joe wore, and curious eyes must have
simply reached the conclusion that his coming was but another
link in the chain of mystery surrounding the house.</p>
<p>Once in the hall, the detective quietly closed the door,
making sure it was fast.</p>
<p>Enough light came in through the glass above to show him the
stairs.</p>
<p>There was carpet on the floor.</p>
<p>Near by were folding doors, and, as they stood ajar, Darrell
poked his head through, not merely out of curiosity, but because
he felt that he had an interest in the matter.</p>
<p>The parlor was furnished.</p>
<p>It was no empty house into which he had come thus
surreptitiously.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>He
listened.</p>
<p>Not a sound from within.</p>
<p>How strange it seemed.</p>
<p>What could it all mean?</p>
<p>Vague and even terrible ideas flashed into his mind&mdash;was
Joe connected with some secret cabal or society that met here
every day?</p>
<p>Perhaps some awful secret was gnawing at his vitals, and daily
sapping his life.</p>
<p>What was that?</p>
<p>A door slammed above.</p>
<p>Eric was glad to hear it, for he realized that the house had
something human about it.</p>
<p>As near as he could judge the sound came from upstairs.</p>
<p>Then he would not have to grapple with the demons of the
underground world.</p>
<p>At times even the oddest fancies will surge through the most
prosaic mind.</p>
<p>One of the thoughts that had come to him was that possibly Joe
had become connected with some gang of counterfeiters&mdash;he
had heard of things just as strange&mdash;and although it seemed
a preposterous idea in connection with Joe, still it had already
become apparent that there was something very strange connected
with him and why not this as well as any other?</p>
<p><a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>Lately Eric had been reading Doctor Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde, and his mind was full of strange fancies concerning the
awful change that was wont to come over that unfortunate being,
who lived two lives, each unknown to the other.</p>
<p>It did not seem possible that Joe Leslie could be doing this
exactly, but he might be carrying on two characters
successfully.</p>
<p>At his business and his home up-town he was known as Joseph G.
Leslie&mdash;on Twenty-seventh Street he might be Mr.
Lester.&nbsp; To tear the mask away and expose the truth was what
brought the detective here now.</p>
<p>In the interest of justice he was bound to do this much.</p>
<p>Then again he thought of Lillian.</p>
<p>In his indignation he wished she could be there to face her
husband when his guilty secret was laid bare.</p>
<p>It might seem cruel&mdash;so does the hot iron of the doctor
when applied to the marks left by the teeth of an enraged dog,
but it is done with kindness&mdash;heroic treatment saves one
from something more terrible beyond.&nbsp; Perhaps, if faced by
Lillian, Joe would break down and receive a shock that would last
him all the rest of his natural life.</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>So
the detective made up his mind not to betray his presence now if
he could help it, but reserve the <i>denouement</i> to a later
date, when it could be made more dramatic.</p>
<p>All he meant to do now was to secure certain evidence for
future use.</p>
<p>The stairs, being carpeted, gave forth no sound when he began
ascending.</p>
<p>He felt rather peculiar about this whole business&mdash;had
this man been a stranger he would not have experienced this same
uneasiness; but Joe Leslie&mdash;to think that he should be upon
the track of his old friend, and with such a purpose in view.</p>
<p>Once the stairs creaked under his weight and he stood
still&mdash;the sound was preternaturally loud in an empty house;
but there was no result, so that he presently continued his
course of exploration.</p>
<p>Vehicles rumbled past the house&mdash;he could hear them
plainly, as though some window were open near at hand.</p>
<p>Just as he reached the top of the stairs a cough reached his
ears&mdash;it was a man who gave utterance to it, probably
Joe.</p>
<p>No voices?</p>
<p><a name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>How
singular!</p>
<p>Eric Darrell&rsquo;s wonder arose with each passing
moment&mdash;strange to say, he was trembling all over now with
excitement.</p>
<p>No living soul had ever seen this man in such a condition
before, which fact went to prove how deep his interest was in the
game he was now pursuing.</p>
<p>Not for worlds would he have stopped, now that his hand was on
the plow.</p>
<p>The end must be near, and Joe&rsquo;s deep secret could not
long remain such&mdash;it must be met and dragged to the
light.</p>
<p>Darrell looked around him, since he was now at the head of the
stairs.</p>
<p>The house seemed to be furnished throughout, and yet there
seemed an air of desertion and loneliness about it, as though it
lacked the daily care of a housekeeper&mdash;little things seemed
to be lacking that would indicate the fact of its being a
habitation that was occupied&mdash;where human beings lived and
moved.</p>
<p>Somehow this fact impressed itself on the detective&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<p>He did not have much time for thought, as action was
necessary.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>When
the brave soldier finds himself face to face with the enemy, he
does not spend the minutes in reflection, but acts.</p>
<p>So with Eric&mdash;he had looked forward to this period for
quite a time, and now that it had arrived, he was not the one to
tarry.</p>
<p>Where was Joe?</p>
<p>As nearly as he could place them the sounds had come from the
front room.</p>
<p>He crept silently along in that direction&mdash;the door was
open, and nothing prevented his seeing the interior of the
apartment.</p>
<p>It was furnished, but did not contain a single
occupant&mdash;light crept through the inside blinds, sufficient
to show him this fact, and his wonder was simply increased to a
fever heat.</p>
<p>In the name of heaven, what did all this strange mystery
mean&mdash;where was Joe&mdash;what freak induced him to come
here, and&mdash;</p>
<p>An odd, crackling sound reached his ears&mdash;ah! it
proceeded from a small room used as a dressing-room, the door of
which was closed.</p>
<p>Eric crept over to it and listened&mdash;all was as still as
death within.</p>
<p>Baffled in this endeavor, he leaned against the door, pressing
his ear close to the panel, to <a name="page115"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 115</span>catch any voices&mdash;if
conspirators were gathered there they must talk&mdash;this
silence could not be long maintained.</p>
<p>The door must have been on the latch&mdash;at any rate it was
not fastened, and as Eric leaned against it this impediment to
his vision slowly gave way, opening a foot or so, and Joe
Leslie&rsquo;s terrible secret was revealed to the
detective&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<h2><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THAT MEERSCHAUM PIPE</span></h2>
<p>In his time Eric Darrell had seen many strange sights, and
experienced odd sensations; but the spectacle that now presented
itself to his wondering eyes created a feeling within him such as
had never yet come upon him.</p>
<p>He gaped in amazement, scarcely able to believe his
senses.</p>
<p>To such a high pitch had his expectations been drawn that he
looked for something of a startling nature.</p>
<p>The shock was tremendous, and yet it rather proceeded from a
sudden revulsion of feeling, than because the scene exceeded his
expectations.</p>
<p>There was but one occupant in the small apartment, upon the
threshold of which he stood when the door gave way so
unceremoniously.</p>
<p>This was Joe.</p>
<p>He was dressed differently than when Eric <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>had seen
him enter the house, and seemed to have on an old suit of
clothes, while a soft hat was drawn down upon his head.</p>
<p>He lay back in an easy chair, from which he started up in
wonder and alarm as the door was thus burst open.</p>
<p>Darrell noted one thing.</p>
<p>In his hand Joe held a large meerschaum pipe and the white
smoke was curling upward from the end of it in wreaths.</p>
<p>Before him was the conspirator, caught in the act,
red-handed.</p>
<p>No wonder Joe turned fiery red.</p>
<p>The inside blind was closed, but the window appeared to be
open.</p>
<p>Joe had a lamp lighted&mdash;doubtless the gas was turned off
from the house, as it generally is from an empty or unoccupied
building&mdash;and most men prefer to see when smoking.</p>
<p>Over Eric Darrell there swept a wave of feeling.&nbsp; All his
old regard for this good-natured giant rushed back to him.</p>
<p>He held Joe&rsquo;s secret.</p>
<p>Thank heaven it was not more serious.</p>
<p>As for Joe himself, not recognizing the other, he sprang up in
a belligerent way.</p>
<p><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>&ldquo;Hello, here!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s wanted?&rdquo;
he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The deuce take it&mdash;who are you?&rdquo;
uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was enough.</p>
<p>Leslie advanced, holding out his hand in a sort of hesitating,
shamefaced way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! old man, glad to see you, but I declare I
didn&rsquo;t know you at first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I you, Joe,&rdquo; calmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so&mdash;I do look like a tramp,
don&rsquo;t I?&rdquo; with a glance at his own person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t that, but I was amazed at finding you
engaged in such a business when you declared to me you had quit
smoking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe turned still redder in confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darrell, you&rsquo;re mistaken&mdash;I&rsquo;ve never
told a living man that!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! didn&rsquo;t you refuse my cigar?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And say&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had quit smoking cigars at the request of my
wife.&nbsp; Well, I have, and not a cigar has passed my lips
since that day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric burst out laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Joe, my boy, I see it all.&nbsp; You were <a
name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 119</span>unable to
keep to the letter of your promise and you have been maintaining
this bachelor&rsquo;s hall ever since, where once a day you have
crept in to have a good smoke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, what you say is true&mdash;I am a slave to the
weed, and I dare not confess it to my wife.&nbsp; She despises
such slaves.&nbsp; My ears have tingled many a time at the
sarcastic way in which she referred to such poor devils, at the
same time thanking heaven that she had a husband with stamina
enough to give up the vile habit when he became
civilized.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe groaned and looked at his meerschaum pipe with a strange
mixture of disgust and veneration.</p>
<p>He had a sympathetic auditor, for Eric was just as deep in the
mud as he was in the mire, so far as smoking was concerned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you say may be true, Joe, and yet it would be well
for you to drop on your marrowbones at once and confess all to
your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! do you mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do, indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t&mdash;she will despise me.&nbsp; I
had better make a determined effort to throw off this wretched
habit, even if it kills me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&ldquo;You make a mistake in one thing, old man.&nbsp;
I believe your wife, instead of reproaching you, will throw her
arms around your neck and tell you to smoke after this when you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Goodness gracious! why should she do this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because she will be so delighted to discover that it is
no worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No worse&mdash;it is as bad as it could be in her
estimation.&nbsp; I shall feel like a criminal,&rdquo; and the
good-natured giant shuddered.</p>
<p>He was not accustomed to deceit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you mark my words&mdash;she will reproach you
less than you believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak in riddles&mdash;why should she be delighted
to know it is no worse&mdash;why are you here&mdash;Heavens
alive, man, has she employed you to watch me&mdash;does she
already know I am engaged in this shameful deceit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He poured these questions out.</p>
<p>Already a light was beginning to shine before his eyes.</p>
<p>The detective smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank your stars, Joe Leslie, that when you face your
sweet wife you have nothing more serious to confess than this
fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you suspect&mdash;what does she think?&rdquo;
he asked, almost breathlessly.</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>&ldquo;That you were false to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darrell, I&rsquo;d sooner be torn to pieces than be
such a wretch,&rdquo; he declared, vehemently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you now, Joe, but must confess that up to
this very hour things looked black for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Circumstances were against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me all, Eric&mdash;everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective sees no reason why he should not.&nbsp; He
believes in this man thoroughly now, and would trust him through
everything.</p>
<p>So he begins and tells him all.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s head rests upon his hand&mdash;the detective could
not see his face, but he knew how it worked with feeling, and
when he described how Lillian was dreadfully shocked when she
heard of the <i>bal masque</i> and Joe&rsquo;s apparent presence
there, he was not at all surprised to see a large tear drop upon
the arm of the chair.</p>
<p>With tears in his eyes Joe looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darrell, you ought to know me better than that.&nbsp; I
am not that kind of a man.&nbsp; My whole life is wrapped up in
my wife, and if I should lose her, either by death or any other
means, it would kill me outright.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>&ldquo;I believe it, Joe, I do indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he finished his story.</p>
<p>Joe was greatly wrought up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall go to Lillian at once&mdash;she shall hear the
truth from my lips first, not yours.&nbsp; Perhaps she will
forgive me.&nbsp; If she says the word I will break my
pipe&rdquo;&mdash;with a sort of sob&mdash;&ldquo;and quit the
whole infernal business if it kills me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can arrange it so that she will beg you to smoke,
Joe.&nbsp; Depend upon it, Lillian has learned that there are
evils a thousand times worse than the one habit to which you are
addicted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Eric, you don&rsquo;t believe this thing of
my being at the <i>bal masque</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not, and yet just see how circumstantial evidence
will hang a man.&nbsp; The chain of evidence was complete.&nbsp;
You went out on an apparent quixotic errand; I saw a man with
your figure escort a lady into that place; his name, singularly
enough was Joe, and I heard some one say she was a Mrs. Lester or
something of that kind, while I heard her tell the driver
Twenty-seventh Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; muttered poor Joe, appalled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse still, your wife showed me a picture of her
sister, at my request.&nbsp; I pretended to be <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>interested
and spoke of your joking me, and my promise to call when that
sister came from California.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my horror I heard that man whom I supposed to be
you, call that dark-haired lady at the masquerade by that
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; You can imagine the awful feelings it
aroused within me; the whole thing seemed so plain that I was
appalled.&nbsp; Joe Leslie dropped from the high place he held in
my esteem and at that time I almost hated you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder at it, old fellow, and think all
the more of you for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Later on I became vacillating&mdash;several things
occurred that broke me up completely, among others the statement
made by your driver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He declared you were down town all the evening and to
prove it stated that he had talked with an officer I know just at
midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I proved this true, and that aroused my suspicions for
the first time.&nbsp; If you were down town you could not be at
the <i>bal masque</i> at the same minute&mdash;for it was a few
minutes before <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>midnight that the melee occurred and the man I thought
to be you floored his assailants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&nbsp; I must hunt up this Joe Lester and
discover who and what he is.&nbsp; Perhaps we have been playing
the two Dromios again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe had knocked the ashes from his pipe and locked the
treasure up in a closet in the larger front room, where his
clothes were hanging.</p>
<p>The artful villain was wont to change his garments when he
entered here, in order that he might not go home saturated with
tobacco smoke.</p>
<p>Eric saw the whole thing plainly.</p>
<p>He felt in exuberant spirits.</p>
<p>So far as Joe was concerned, the whole business had turned out
delightfully.</p>
<p>Just then the detective&rsquo;s mind did not turn in any other
direction.</p>
<p>He forgot all about the other side of the case, and seemed to
consider the matter settled.</p>
<p>Peace would again come upon the disturbed family relations of
his friend Joe, and all be as lovely as of yore.</p>
<p>Of course Lillian would be only too glad to close up the
matter by forgiving her husband.</p>
<p>His sin was not a grievous one, and so great would be her
relief at finding him faithful and true that she would gladly
forget it all.</p>
<p><a name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>Under
these circumstances Darrell watched Joe get into his clothes with
sincere satisfaction.</p>
<p>He had never been more worried over anything than he was with
this, and now that it had all turned out so well, he felt a
satisfaction that seemed to permeate his whole system.</p>
<p>When Joe had dressed himself, he seemed to have made up his
mind about a certain thing.</p>
<p>Taking the beloved meerschaum pipe out of the closet, he laid
it in a case and tucked the whole under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that for?&rdquo; asked Eric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall smash it to pieces&mdash;I cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t believe Lillian ever will.&nbsp;
Make a clean breast of it, old fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I intend to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are safe&mdash;she is too gentle not to
forgive, and I expect to see you soon smoking a cigar on the
street like other men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I can&rsquo;t do that&mdash;I would feel like a
wretch to ever do that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mark my words, she will insist on it&mdash;her scruples
must vanish, and I expect she will really enjoy the flavor of a
fine cigar soon, when her Joe is at the other end of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe smiled dismally&mdash;he realized that he had <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>business
before him that would try his nerves, for as a man he had pride
and must now humble himself before the woman he loved!&nbsp; But
his mind was made up, and he actually felt already as though a
load had been taken from his shoulders&mdash;just as the prodigal
son, as soon as he decided to return to his father, experienced a
new feeling of peace.</p>
<p>They left the house and parted at the elevated station, one
going up, the other down town.</p>
<p>As he reached the platform, the detective suddenly felt a cold
shiver go over him at sight of a man.</p>
<p>It was Paul Prescott, the artist.</p>
<p>There rushed over Eric the memory of that other half of the
mystery, and he groaned&mdash;this time his sympathy was with Joe
and not his wife.</p>
<h2><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ALL IS FORGIVEN</span></h2>
<p>Joe Leslie never felt so mean in all his life as when he
approached his house up town on this evening.</p>
<p>He knew he had been playing a miserable part in deceiving his
wife with regard to his smoking, but subterfuge was something
generally foreign to Joe&rsquo;s nature, and this made it seem
all the worse to him.</p>
<p>Still, he did not sneak along in a cringing way.&nbsp; Never
had he walked more uprightly&mdash;for he could look people in
the face now, at least, and was determined to make a clean breast
of it.</p>
<p>Lillian was watching from the parlor window, herself hidden
from view.</p>
<p>She thought she had never seen Joe looked so manly, as when he
walked up to the house, and her heart seemed cold to think that
it may have been the smiles of some rival that brought this look
of pleasure to his face.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>Thus
a man may feel mean, and at the same time appear joyous.</p>
<p>When Joe entered the house he saw a light back in the
library.</p>
<p>Straight in that direction he walked.</p>
<p>Lillian was seated there apparently reading&mdash;how was he
to know she had hastily flown hither from her lookout?</p>
<p>Joe softly closed the door.&nbsp; Another minute and he stood
before his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lillian, my wife, look up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Somewhat startled, she did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Joe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to know what a base man you have for a
husband, Lillian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I have a confession to make, and I am determined
to make it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A confession, Joseph&mdash;&rdquo; and the little woman
gained her feet.</p>
<p>Her face was white with a sudden fear&mdash;she even believed
Joe was about to tell her some terrible truth&mdash;that he had
never loved her&mdash;perhaps had been married ere he knew
her.</p>
<p>At any rate she was dreadfully alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have been a villain to treat the best <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>little
woman in all the world so, but this old love was with me long
before I knew you&mdash;it had become a part of my very
life.&nbsp; I never knew how strong it was until lately.&nbsp;
God knows I have tried to shake it off, and be faithful to my
promise, but I am weak.&nbsp; I have sinned, Lillian, my wife,
and I stand here humbly to ask if you can ever forgive
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood there with bowed head, proud even in his
humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But oh, Joe, to think&mdash;that woman&mdash;&rdquo;
and she burst into a torrent of tears.</p>
<p>He seized her hands and took them down from her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Lillian, I forgot that you believed
that.&nbsp; It is no woman&mdash;I have never been unfaithful to
you in word or deed&mdash;that was not I whom Darrell saw at the
<i>bal masque</i> last night, dear.&nbsp; I am yours, wretched
man that I am, but yours alone, always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&mdash;I don&rsquo;t understand&mdash;you say
you have sinned and yet that you are innocent.&nbsp; Oh, Joe,
please tell me everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would be a base wretch if I did not.&nbsp; Do you
remember making me give a promise before we were married,
Lillian?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>&ldquo;Not about your cigars, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; eagerly; &ldquo;and for a time
I suffered terrible torments in keeping it to the letter; but
after a while the devil tempted me.&nbsp; He said, &lsquo;You
promised to give up cigars&mdash;nothing was said about your
pipe.&rsquo;&nbsp; Lillian, like a weak fool I gave in, and daily
almost, for months, I have gone to the house I own in
Twenty-seventh Street, changed my clothes and enjoyed half an
hour&rsquo;s smoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a cruel deception on you, and I have felt like a
sneak in doing it.&nbsp; Thanks to Darrell my eyes have been
opened and I am here to confess all, asking
forgiveness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lillian could hardly believe her ears&mdash;she turned a face
illumined upon her husband.&nbsp; &ldquo;Joe, dear Joe, is this
your dreadful secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sure you have told me everything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not another thing I have ever kept from you,
my darling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you love no one else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a living soul but my wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I am so glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words she flew into his arms, and Joe, bending
down, gravely kissed his own.</p>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>&ldquo;You are sure you can forgive me,
dearest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive you&mdash;oh, Joe, I shall <i>love</i> tobacco
after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, I have brought my pipe here for you to
destroy&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t quite do it myself, for I&rsquo;ve
had it many years.&nbsp; But you shall be the
executioner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for worlds&mdash;if this is the only rival I have
to fear I can share my place in your heart with it.&nbsp; You
shall smoke after dinner, and I myself will fill your
pipe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her fingers tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! dearest, what a fool I have been all this while, to
suffer as I have when by confession I might have long since been
absolved.&nbsp; But I am sincere in my resolve to stop
smoking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am just as firmly resolved that you shall
not.&nbsp; I am cured of my folly.&nbsp; But for that foolish
prejudice you would never have been led to deceive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They held sweet communion for some little time, and all seemed
as lovely as during the bright days of their courtship.</p>
<p>Then the dinner bell rang.</p>
<p>Together they went down, Joe&rsquo;s arm around his wife, as
though they were lovers.</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>After
the meal was over they again sought the library, and chatted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for your pipe, Joe, dear,&rdquo; said Lillian.</p>
<p>He protested.</p>
<p>It was of no avail&mdash;she was determined that he had
suffered enough&mdash;better love with a cigar in the house than
the absence of both.</p>
<p>Few men will condemn Joe&rsquo;s weakness.</p>
<p>In other respects he could be adamant, but he owned up to
being very fond of a smoke.</p>
<p>So Lillian took his bag of tobacco out of the case which also
held the pipe, filled the bowl and brought it to him.</p>
<p>He kissed her on the spot&mdash;what else could he do?</p>
<p>&ldquo;A match, please, dear, since you insist upon it&mdash;I
am out of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the holder is also empty&mdash;stay, here is a
scrap of paper that will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She took a piece out of the waste basket and, without looking
at it, twisted a lighter.</p>
<p>This she held in the gas jet, and, lighted, brought it over to
Joe, who calmly laid it on his pipe, puffed a few times, and
then, blowing out the flame, knocked the red ashes off the
lighter, laying it on the table for possible use again.</p>
<p><a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>Then
he eyed his wife quizzically.</p>
<p>She was looking at him with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel like a brute, Lillian, to inflict such a torment
upon you.&nbsp; Say the word, and the whole thing goes
forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I,&rdquo; she replied; &ldquo;I never knew how
fragrant the odor was.&nbsp; If you must smoke, my husband, you
shall do it as other gentlemen do, in your own home, but always
smoke the best cigars and few of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was charming, Joe thought.</p>
<p>He had not been so happy for months.</p>
<p>It often happens that the skies are clearest just before the
worst of storms.</p>
<p>Joe saw no cloud on the horizon.</p>
<p>All the same it was there, and ready to blot out the sunshine
like magic.</p>
<p>It came about in a peculiar way.</p>
<p>Lillian had settled down to read a book she was interested in,
and Joe had his paper.</p>
<p>While he read he mechanically fingered the lighter with the
charred end, and untwisted it.</p>
<p>Finally he looked over his paper at his wife and mused.</p>
<p>How good she was to make his penance so light and how happy he
ought to be in the possession of such a dear little woman.</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>Evidently Joe had forgotten something.</p>
<p>He found his pipe had gone out during his musing, and taking
hold of the paper she had twisted for him, was about to make a
lighter out of it again, when he received what seemed to be an
electric shock.</p>
<p>A name had caught his eye on the paper.&nbsp; He held it up
closer.</p>
<p>Yes, there could be no mistake&mdash;it was a note his wife
had twisted up&mdash;by some mistake it had come into his waste
basket.</p>
<p>What was left of it after the burning he read:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;if you can contrive to conceal it from your
husband until then, all will be well.&nbsp; I think I can rely
upon your discretion&mdash;everything goes on well, and our
secret is, I believe, safe.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Faithfully yours,</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Paul
Prescott</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When poor Joe had taken this in he felt as though he had been
plunged into an icy bath.</p>
<p>The joyous spirit of contentment that had pervaded his whole
being was gone.</p>
<p>Suspicion, jealousy, unrest, came trooping in with renewed
force.</p>
<p>His own late experience should have been a lesson to him, but
it was not.</p>
<p><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>The
first thing he did was to fold the paper up and put it in his
pocket.</p>
<p>Why he did this he often wondered later on, when the right
course would have been to have handed it to Lillian for
explanation.</p>
<p>He looked at his paper again, but did not see that he had it
upside down.</p>
<p>Thought was busy.</p>
<p>He was trying to convince himself that it was none of his
business anyhow&mdash;that he had had his secret and why not
Lillian.</p>
<p>Then again he remembered that she was his wife&mdash;what
concerned her concerned him.</p>
<p>At any rate Joe&rsquo;s sudden happiness was
overcast&mdash;clouds had covered the sky.</p>
<p>He began to feel miserable.</p>
<p>As it was not his design that Lillian should see this, he
assumed a cheerfulness he was far from feeling.</p>
<p>The evening passed.</p>
<p>Joe wished to get in a closet at one end of the room, but
found it locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder where the key of this door is.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
sure I didn&rsquo;t take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accidentally he chanced to look toward Lillian while speaking,
and was almost startled to see the color fly into her face.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&ldquo;I believe I left it up-stairs, Joe.&nbsp; If you
really want it I might go up and see if I can get it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! no, dear, it doesn&rsquo;t matter.&nbsp; Another
time will do as well,&rdquo; he said carelessly.</p>
<p>At the same time, for the life of him he could not help
associating her action with the letter received from Paul
Prescott.</p>
<p>It worried him.</p>
<p>He was diverted from this state by Lillian, who asked about
the clerk, so Joe told all that had been done the night
before&mdash;he had spoken of it ere now, but had not given
particulars.</p>
<p>Woman-like she was interested, and declared she loved him
better because of the mercy he had shown for the boy.</p>
<p>Then Lillian retired.</p>
<p>Joe sat there a long time thinking.</p>
<p>Finally he got up and went over to the closet as if to effect
an entrance, trying several of the keys on his bunch but with no
success.</p>
<p>Then he walked up and down.</p>
<p>At times he was dejected and again his face seemed to speak of
sudden passion.</p>
<p>Human nature is a strange thing.</p>
<p>A man enters an omnibus and frowns to hear <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>the growls
of those comfortably settled as they make room for
him&mdash;presently another comes in, and his growls at being
forced to squeeze into a smaller compass exceed the rest.</p>
<p>Joe, upstairs, discovered the missing key on the dainty
dresser of his wife&rsquo;s room&mdash;he took it in his hand,
started for the door, stopped, made an impatient gesture, and
returned the key to the place where he found it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suspect her&mdash;never,&rdquo; he muttered, and yet at
the very moment his feelings had gotten beyond his
control&mdash;it was pride that kept him from venturing to pry
into her secret and discover what lay hidden in the library
closet.</p>
<p>Thus Joe had won and lost a victory.</p>
<h2><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE OPIUM JOINT</span></h2>
<p>Eric Darrell watched the man whom he had thus met on the
platform of the elevated station.&nbsp; He wondered what magical
power Paul Prescott possessed over Joe Leslie&rsquo;s wife.</p>
<p>The man was odd looking, as a genius is ever supposed to be,
but there was nothing about him to indicate that he might be a
masher or a heart-breaker.</p>
<p>Darrell looked him over, taking a mental measurement of the
man, as he had a dim idea the time might be near at hand when
they would be on opposite sides.</p>
<p>The other left the train.&nbsp; Darrell followed him.</p>
<p>Presently he saw a woman join the artist and hand him a note,
which he seemed to read with great eagerness, then he hurried
off.</p>
<p>The keen eyes of the detective had noted something of extreme
importance.</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>When
Prescott believed he put the note away in his pocket, in reality
it fluttered down to the pavement as he hastened away.</p>
<p>In just five seconds by the watch it was in the possession of
Eric Darrell.</p>
<p>He then continued on his way to his rooms.</p>
<p>Reaching his den he changed his appearance, and appeared in
his natural figure.&nbsp; Then he took out the paper just found
and eagerly scrutinized it; not that he was particularly
interested in the secrets of Paul Prescott, but the artist had
crossed his path, and hence all that he did should be
scrutinized.</p>
<p>As he suspected, the writing was in a lady&rsquo;s
chirography&mdash;so many ladies write alike, as though taught by
a certain school, that individuality is lost.</p>
<p>This is what the detective read, and it opened his eyes in an
astonishing manner:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;My beloved Paul&mdash;I consent at last to
your proposition&mdash;in flight alone we can be safe.&nbsp; I
shall be ready when you come to take me.&nbsp; <i>He</i> will be
like a tiger let loose&mdash;I know his passion.&nbsp; I believe
he would have killed me ere now had he suspected our
secret.&nbsp; Carry out your plan&mdash;I understand, and am
willing to fly from an uncongenial home to the one you will make
for me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">With love, your own</p>
<p style="text-align: right">L.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>That
was all.&nbsp; Heaven knows it was enough.&nbsp; Darrell let the
paper drop on the table with a sharp cry of pain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Joe! poor honest old Joe!&nbsp; You thought you
were deceiving your wife past forgiveness because you chose to
smoke a pipe in secret, and here she conspires to leave you in
the lurch.&nbsp; Joe is the ogre referred to, savage as a
tiger.&nbsp; Woman&mdash;well, I&rsquo;ll be hanged if I want to
know her sister after all.&nbsp; I never was so deceived in all
my life.&nbsp; It is a shame&mdash;an accursed shame, and that
villain shall pay dearly for it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he examined the note again, endeavoring to read between
the lines.</p>
<p>His indignation grew apace.</p>
<p>Joe had proven himself pure gold, and he had more confidence
in him than ever, but there was something here that needed
investigation, and the case looked black for Lillian.</p>
<p>The note was signed with an L.</p>
<p>However, Darrell, always cautious, was not ready to condemn
without a hearing&mdash;what he had already seen this night
taught him the fallacy of circumstantial evidence.</p>
<p>First of all he must secure a scrap of Mrs. Leslie&rsquo;s
handwriting and compare it with that which he held in his
hand.</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>That
could be done in the morning he had no doubt&mdash;it would not
prove a formidable task to one of his executive ability.</p>
<p>There was an ugly look about the business he did not like, and
he was anxious to be at the truth.</p>
<p>About eight o&rsquo;clock, having had his supper, and made
certain inquiries that put him into possession of facts he
desired to know, Darrell found himself watching for Paul Prescott
at the lodgings of the artist.</p>
<p>It was the desire of the detective to acquaint himself with
some of the customs of the man whom he meant to investigate.</p>
<p>This was always his plan when engaged in such a
business&mdash;he found it paid to size a man up and see what his
habits were.</p>
<p>When a man was suspected of being a forger, or a check raiser,
or a defaulter, Darrell&rsquo;s very first action was to discover
who his usual companions were, where he passed his leisure time,
and whether he was addicted to little vices.&nbsp; His secret
character always told the story.</p>
<p>A young man might be a Sunday-school teacher, and apparently
as straight as a die to all outward appearances, but if Darrell
on <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>tracking him found that he secretly frequented gambling
houses he knew he had his man.</p>
<p>What does it avail if the outside of the peach is fair to gaze
upon when all is rotten below?</p>
<p>So he now desired to learn what this peculiar looking artist
really was.</p>
<p>He had a good reputation among people generally, but then this
counted as little.</p>
<p>Much dross might be taken for pure gold did not the assayer
apply his tests.</p>
<p>That was what Darrell did&mdash;looked into each man&rsquo;s
private character, unknown to the individual under the
scrutiny.</p>
<p>He seemed to take it for granted that the artist would come
out, and in this he appeared to make no mistake.&nbsp; Sure
enough Prescott appeared.</p>
<p>He was evidently off for the evening, but did not dress as
though he meant to spend it in fashionable society.</p>
<p>Darrell followed him to a certain club where artists were wont
to congregate, and here the other seemed quite a favorite.</p>
<p>At half-past eleven Prescott left this place.&nbsp; He did not
head toward home.</p>
<p>On the contrary he seemed ill at ease, and <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>looked
around him once or twice as though he were afraid lest some of
his fellows at the club should be near.</p>
<p>This action in itself was suspicious to Eric&mdash;it
indicated that the artist had certain habits which he desired to
keep a secret even from those who would have thought the least of
it.</p>
<p>Darrell&rsquo;s curiosity was at once aroused.</p>
<p>He realized that now the game would probably be worth the
hunting.</p>
<p>At any rate, since the opportunity was now given him, he was
determined to learn more about the artist than he had known
before.</p>
<p>Paul Prescott headed down town, boarding a Third Avenue street
car near Fourteenth Street.&nbsp; On the same car, out in front,
stood Eric, enjoying the bracing night air.</p>
<p>He could see without being seen, and managed to keep an eye on
the artist.&nbsp; When he saw the other finally rise he knew he
was about to leave the car, and the detective forestalled
him.</p>
<p>Once on the pavement he waited for his man and then shadowed
him.</p>
<p>Darrell was not greatly surprised at what he learned&mdash;the
place he entered was an opium joint, kept by a Chinaman and an
American in <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>partnership, probably the largest about town.&nbsp;
Here a good class of customers were wont to resort, and among
others several actors, a doctor, a well known jurist, a writer,
together with several women, whose attire and jewelry proved them
to belong to the upper circle.</p>
<p>Many a man&rsquo;s history received a downward impetus dating
from the hour he first entered this den of iniquity.</p>
<p>Darrell knew it well.</p>
<p>He had been in it a number of times in the course of the last
year&mdash;those whom he hunted had come here.</p>
<p>A clerk had robbed his employer for money to pay the opium
fiend&mdash;once the habit gains full sway and the victim will do
anything on earth in order to get money to pay for a few pipes
and an hour of the peculiar drunken fancy.</p>
<p>Knowing the ropes was of assistance to the detective now.</p>
<p>He went in, and assuming the eager, trembling manner of an
habitue demanded a bunk and a pipe.&nbsp; All the while he used
his eyes.</p>
<p>The room was supplied with lounges and settees&mdash;the usual
bunks were in another apartment where the Chinese and cheaper
grade of <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>smokers could indulge their pet vice for a smaller
sum.</p>
<p>This place was furnished with something of Oriental splendor,
and the detective could not but admire the barbaric taste of the
proprietor.</p>
<p>The couches spread around were soft and inviting, Turkish in
their make&mdash;some had curtains partly drawn, so that the
occupant was half screened.</p>
<p>Three of these were occupied by women.&nbsp; This was no
uncommon sight.</p>
<p>That two of them wore veils was evidence that they had not yet
been hardened by the drug; but all this would come in time.</p>
<p>The third had thrown her veil back, and her set face could be
seen, the eyes staring into vacancy, as though sightless.</p>
<p>Wretched sinners that they were, drawn onward by the
inexorable god at whose altar they worshiped, there was no escape
for them&mdash;just ahead lay the black gulf of despair, toward
which they were hurrying so rapidly, and soon it must close over
them.</p>
<p>Then&mdash;eternity!</p>
<p>Darrell never entered here without a feeling of commiseration
for the poor souls thus linked with the skeleton arms of
death.</p>
<p><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>Had
the opportunity ever offered he would gladly have tried to save
one or more of them; but he was well aware what a difficult and
well nigh impossible task it is to endeavor to save a man against
himself.</p>
<p>Luckily Eric possessed a peculiar disposition&mdash;what
little opium he smoked had no effect on him, and he had no
longing for the drug as the generality have.</p>
<p>On the contrary it almost nauseated him, and he could only
have become an habitual opium fiend by long and persistent
practice.</p>
<p>He glanced around to see where the artist had deposited his
frame, and discovered Prescott on the couch next the second
veiled lady.</p>
<p>Whether this was accident or design the detective was unable
to decide as yet, but he had an idea and steadily nursed it.</p>
<p>His feeling of mingled disgust and pity was greatest for these
women&mdash;he knew the one whose face he saw was a well-to-do
widow up on Lexington Avenue, and perhaps the others were friends
who had come here first in a spirit of bravado and daring
curiosity, perhaps upon a wager, and whom the fascination of the
drug had already chained to the chariot wheels of <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>the ogre
Opium.&nbsp; Those wheels revolved slowly but
remorselessly&mdash;sooner or later they would crush out the life
of all who clung to them.</p>
<p>Had Prescott anything in common with this rich and brazen
widow and her friends?</p>
<p>That he knew the former Darrell had already guessed, for her
set expression had momentarily changed at sight of the man, and
the detective caught a look of deep cunning, which was returned
with a smile and a nod from the man.</p>
<p>Eager to learn all he could of the artist&rsquo;s private
character, the detective determined to watch for all he was
worth.</p>
<p>He was also ready to find out who the two veiled women were,
who set aside all modesty and came to this public opium joint
because they could not properly prepare and enjoy the drug at
their homes.</p>
<p>At a certain hour no doubt a closed carriage would be waiting
to convey them all home&mdash;perhaps the dashing widow had some
male friend present who would serve as an escort.</p>
<p>Prescott received his pipe, prepared his pill and was soon
smoking quietly.</p>
<p>Silence rested upon the place&mdash;people came not here to
converse, but to dream with open <a name="page148"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 148</span>eyes, seeing the beautiful things
that danced before their eyes like a bright <i>ignis fatuus</i>,
always eluding their grasp, yet luring them deeper and deeper
into the toils.</p>
<h2><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A TERRIBLE DOOM</span></h2>
<p>Before Eric Darrell had been in the place ten minutes he made
a discovery that had a strong bearing on the case.</p>
<p>This was in reference to the artist.</p>
<p>Paul Prescott had shown all the signs of an opium
smoker&rsquo;s eagerness to have a draw at the subtle drug when
he came in.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Eric had already decided that much of this was
assumed.</p>
<p>His own experience showed how such a thing could be; hence, he
believed another might copy the same signs of distress with equal
success.</p>
<p>Then Prescott had a reason for coming here other than the
desire to smoke.</p>
<p>What could it be?</p>
<p>Darrell had eyes, and he was able to form conclusions very
speedily.</p>
<p>He knew that the presence of the dark-veiled woman in the bunk
adjoining that taken by the artist, was what had drawn him.</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>Circumstances pointed to this fact&mdash;their heads
were close together, one resting upon the right, the other upon
the left side.</p>
<p>The detective&rsquo;s thoughts were busy.</p>
<p>He remembered the note.</p>
<p>Could this veiled creature be the party signing that
missive?</p>
<p>According to the conclusions he had already drawn this could
not be so, for he had made up his mind that the writer must be
Lillian, and only waited to prove this fact.</p>
<p>Who then was the veiled lady?</p>
<p>Bah! such a man as Paul Prescott might be engaged in half a
dozen little love affairs at one and the same time.</p>
<p>He would finally abandon all the rest for the charmer who held
his fickle heart most heavily chained, or else whose bank account
was the most promising.</p>
<p>To a man of Darrell&rsquo;s steadiness of purpose, there was
something almost revolting about such a character as this, and
yet he found certain things to study in the artist&rsquo;s
face&mdash;points that rather puzzled him when scrutinized.</p>
<p>The man was worthy of being analyzed.&nbsp; There might be
more to him than even appeared upon the surface.</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>Darrell was wide awake, although he pretended to be
already under the magic influence.</p>
<p>He was soothed by the odor of the opium, without giving way to
it, and watched the couple across the way.</p>
<p>The hanging curtains partly concealed him, and he was sure a
note passed from one to the other.&nbsp; If the girl thus heavily
veiled was in the charge of the widow, the latter did not seem in
a condition to watch over her ward, for she had given herself up
wholly to her dreams.</p>
<p>In the silence of this den of human misery, where each victim
was bound to his neighbor by the same chains that made him a
slave, a long stride was taken on this night toward the oblivion
of death.</p>
<p>Strange scenes sometimes occur in these places, and one was on
the tapis for this night.</p>
<p>So interested had the detective been in watching the couple
opposite, that he seldom glanced at any of the others.</p>
<p>By mere chance his eyes alighted upon the second veiled woman,
and at the same moment he saw that something was wrong.</p>
<p>She had swept her veil aside, and the light revealed a face at
once handsome and dissipated&mdash;she had been a beauty earlier
in life.</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>Just
now this face was distorted.&nbsp; Pain racked it.</p>
<p>Eric Darrell saw the awful hand of death there&mdash;he knew
the wretched woman must have some heart trouble which was
aggravated by the opium, and that she was dying.</p>
<p>He beckoned to the Yankee who represented the American side of
the firm.</p>
<p>Then he pointed to the struggling woman.&nbsp; The other
sprang to her.</p>
<p>There was a gasp and all was over&mdash;death had come to her
in the opium den.</p>
<p>By this time Eric was out on the floor, and it was well he
happened to be there, for the man showed the white feather at
once, fearing lest a thing of this kind would ruin his
business.</p>
<p>Luckily a strong hand was at the helm.</p>
<p>The orders Eric gave were obeyed&mdash;no one was allowed to
leave the place.</p>
<p>Most of those present manifested no interest in the
game&mdash;their minds were wholly taken up with heavenly
visions&mdash;death might come and go without their notice.</p>
<p>Eric knew what must be done.</p>
<p>The woman was elegantly dressed&mdash;she was no doubt the
wife of a wealthy citizen, and if it <a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>were known that she had expired in
this fashionable opium joint the shame would be terrible.&nbsp;
He aroused the widow.</p>
<p>The other veiled lady was trembling, having gained her feet,
but she would answer no questions, only sob and wring her hands,
while the artist pretended not to notice any one, though eagerly
taking it all in.</p>
<p>When the dashing widow was brought out of her dreams and made
to realize the truth, she too seemed overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Eric took hold of her.</p>
<p>His strong mind controlled hers, and he soon made her see how
essential it was that this awful business be kept a dead
secret.</p>
<p>She must confide in him, giving the name and address of the
deceased&mdash;he would then see that the body was taken there
unknown to a living soul save the driver, and the secret would be
locked in the breast of her husband.</p>
<p>The world she moved in would attend her funeral, and never
dream that she had died in any other place than at home.</p>
<p>This gave the widow hope.</p>
<p>She whispered the lady&rsquo;s name and residence to the
detective, who wrote them down.</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>He
was surprised to discover that her husband was a prominent
business man down town.</p>
<p>It was an awful business, but he managed it with great
circumspection&mdash;the body was placed in a hack, and the
driver did not know but what she was merely sick.</p>
<p>Eric had also discovered the name and address of the other
veiled lady&mdash;the widow had given it upon his assurance of
good faith.&nbsp; It was Mrs. Collingwood.&nbsp; Her address was
Lexington Avenue.</p>
<p>Darrell&rsquo;s actions were right to the point in a business
light.</p>
<p>His main desire was to save the poor husband all the shame and
mortification possible.</p>
<p>Leaving the hack at the curb he was presently in the presence
of the gentleman, to whom he broke the awful news as gently as
possible.</p>
<p>At first the other was dreadfully shocked, but upon learning
what bold measures the detective had taken to conceal the actual
facts, he overwhelmed the other with thanks.</p>
<p>Between them they got the body into the house, Darrell
speaking to the supposed sick lady in a reassuring way.</p>
<p>The driver was heavily feed and cautioned to <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>hold his
tongue under any and all circumstances.&nbsp; Darrell assisted
the stricken husband to get his dead up into her room.</p>
<p>Then in the library he heard the full particulars from the
detective.</p>
<p>Afterwards, he insisted on telling his story&mdash;how his
once lovely and affectionate wife had secretly taken to the
deadly drug from injections given to make her sleep during a
spell of sickness.&nbsp; The harrowing tale has been often
repeated in such a city as New York&mdash;her power of resistance
became less and less strong, until he could do nothing with
her.</p>
<p>Knowing that she had heart trouble he had been expecting such
a catastrophe, but nevertheless, it had fallen with crushing
force.</p>
<p>He was greatly indebted to the detective for his
assistance&mdash;it was possible that the real facts might be
covered up, and with the help of his family physician the death
be given as simply one from heart disease.</p>
<p>When Eric felt the gentleman&rsquo;s grasp at parting, and saw
the tears upon his sad face, he knew that his visit to the opium
joint had not been without its reward, since he was enabled to
bring deep satisfaction to this soul long <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>harrowed by
the fear of such a catastrophe.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he had the address of the veiled woman with whom
the artist had been in communication at the opium joint.</p>
<p>At his leisure on the morrow he could look her up and learn
all there was connected with his case.</p>
<p>Such a scene as the one thus briefly described has occurred at
an opium den in the great metropolis&mdash;who the ill-fated lady
was no one knew, at least the facts were never made public, and
only a few guessed the truth by watching the death column in the
dailies.</p>
<p>The opium habit gains strength slowly in our midst, but there
are more people slaves to the vice than the public suspects.</p>
<p>Knowing the joint would in all probability be closed for the
remainder of the night, Eric made no attempt to go there but
sought his apartments to rest.</p>
<p>The committee appointed to examine into the strange case of
Leslie vs. Leslie could report progress.</p>
<p>On the morrow the work would be resumed, and a long stride
taken toward the end.</p>
<p>This man had a wonderful power over his <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>mind, and
could control it at will.&nbsp; When he was ready to sleep he
dismissed all thought and secured solid rest, so that when he
woke up his mind was as clear as a bell.&nbsp; To such a fact he
owed much of his success.</p>
<p>With the morning he was up and out.</p>
<p>It was a fair day, and Eric hoped he might look upon this as
an emblem of luck&mdash;that his case might prove as clear.</p>
<p>His first thought was to get some specimen of Mrs.
Leslie&rsquo;s writing.</p>
<p>To do this he must visit the house but waited until Joe would
probably be on his way down to his business.</p>
<p>Then he went to the dwelling up town.</p>
<p>He asked to see Mrs. Leslie and was shown in.&nbsp; Being left
alone for a short time he glanced around as if in hope of seeing
an opportunity to carry out his design.</p>
<p>A desk caught his eye&mdash;if he only had the opportunity to
look through it he felt sure he could find what he wanted, for it
was undoubtedly the property of Lillian Leslie.</p>
<p>There were several books on the library table.&nbsp; These he
examined hastily.</p>
<p>He hoped to find one that Lillian might have <a
name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 158</span>written her
name in, for he believed that it would be easy to compare the
writing and pronounce sentence from that.</p>
<p>In this, however, he was disappointed.</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s name was in several, the books being inscribed,
with love, to his wife.&nbsp; This only proved his great
love.</p>
<p>Eric was ready to swear by it now, and did not mean to let the
case drop until he had sifted it thoroughly&mdash;such honest
affection as Joe&rsquo;s should never be made sport of in a
friend of his, even by the prettiest witch that ever trod the
earth&mdash;at least not with his approval.</p>
<p>The rustle of female attire drew his attention, and, turning,
he found himself face to face with the lady of the house.</p>
<p>He had not sent up his name and she appeared quite surprised
at seeing who it was.&nbsp; &ldquo;You, Mr. Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your service, Mrs. Leslie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you wish this morning, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something of coldness in her tones.&nbsp; He could
not tell whence it sprung, as there were several things that
might cause it.</p>
<p>Perhaps she felt humiliated in his presence because she had
let him see her weakness, jealousy of her husband&rsquo;s
affection.</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Then,
again, if she were guilty she might fear him because he was a
detective and Joe&rsquo;s friend.</p>
<p>He suspended judgment and resolved to study this fair creature
more closely than he had as yet had a chance to do.</p>
<h2><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ANOTHER LINK IN THE CHAIN</span></h2>
<p>All these things had flashed through Darrell&rsquo;s mind with
a rapidity that lightning alone could equal, for there is nothing
more rapid than thought.</p>
<p>He maintained his suave manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come this morning, Mrs. Leslie, for several
things.&nbsp; In the first place I wish to congratulate you on
the fact that Joe&rsquo;s terrible secret, as I made it out, was
after all so simple a thing.&nbsp; Your wifely trust and devotion
had their reward and I can appreciate the feeling of satisfaction
you now possess because of your trust which I could not wholly
beat down, in spite of the proofs I brought, and which must have
appeared &lsquo;strong as holy writ&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was artful of Eric&mdash;he thought to destroy the
barrier by a little flattery, knowing all the while that Lillian
had really been jealous.</p>
<p>It told too.</p>
<p><a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>The
fair lady smiled upon him once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am happy because our bugaboo turned out to be only a
pipe, and Joe has gone off this morning with a cigar&mdash;he
shall smoke when he pleases after this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find that the odor from a good cigar is rather
attractive.&nbsp; At any rate, Joe has done so much for me that I
can afford to give in to one little vice of his.&nbsp; To think
of the poor dear fellow hiding himself away like that.&nbsp; It
makes me almost cry to think how miserably cruel I have been to
him.&nbsp; But I mean to make it up to Joe in the future, Mr.
Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric swallowed a lump that seemed to be sticking in his
throat.</p>
<p>This, the woman whom he suspected of being false to her
husband&mdash;he did not know how it was, but whenever he came
into her presence he seemed to be in some way charmed.</p>
<p>She was a siren.</p>
<p>The same power, exercised by the nymphs of the sea in olden
days, causing the sailors to jump over to their death, is given
to certain of the gentler sex to-day.</p>
<p>Adam sunk all his manhood and forgot his <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>duty to his
Maker when tempted by Eve, and from that day to this few men
there are strong enough to do the right when a beautiful woman
smiles upon them and teaches them the lesson of love.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to describe the influence Lillian had
upon nearly all who came in contact with her&mdash;her manner was
soothing and pleasant, so that general admiration followed her
acquaintance.</p>
<p>Darrell was a man of strong purposes and he put down with a
firm hand any feeling that interfered with his stern sense of
duty.</p>
<p>In a business way he was here to see whether Lillian was what
she appeared to be, or deceptive by nature.</p>
<p>Hence he was not to be charmed from his purpose in any
way.</p>
<p>The human feeling of admiration must give way to the
professional energy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spoke of several reasons for calling to see me, Mr.
Darrell&mdash;will you kindly state what the others are?&rdquo;
she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure, and I trust you will not feel offended,
my dear Mrs. Leslie.&nbsp; It is a custom on my part in a case
like this, to take from the <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>party with whom I have been engaged,
a little note, stating that they have been well satisfied with my
services.&nbsp; I hope you may not think it out of the way and
give me this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She appeared troubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know that I ought to&mdash;such an affair is
essentially private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only desire the paper for my own satisfaction, and
not to show.&nbsp; You can merely state that you are entirely
satisfied with the services of Eric Darrell, and if you prefer,
simply sign your initials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Crafty man&mdash;the initial was what he wanted above all
else.</p>
<p>Her face brightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know that I would object to that, Mr. Darrell,
since my identity is concealed.&nbsp; Do you want it
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; humbly, but secretly exulting
over his success.</p>
<p>She went to the desk, opened it and sat down&mdash;after a
minute&rsquo;s thought she wrote something upon a sheet of
paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will that do, Mr. Darrell?&rdquo; handing it to
him.</p>
<p>He glanced at it and read:</p>
<blockquote><p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&ldquo;This is to certify that Mr. Eric Darrell has
accomplished the work for which I have employed him, in a
thoroughly satisfactory manner, and that I am well satisfied with
his services.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">L. L.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New York, October 7, 188&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Darrell smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks, madam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It answers your purpose?&rdquo; quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although he smiled Eric Darrell felt as though he could have
wept just then.</p>
<p>The one glance he had taken had revealed the fact that the
capital L made by Mrs. Leslie was very similar to the one which
he had seen signed to the note Paul Prescott had let fall.</p>
<p>It was a shock to the detective, even though he had in a
measure expected it.</p>
<p>That point gained he put the matter aside for the present and
continued to appear pleasant, though it was only with an effort
he could do so.</p>
<p>For a little he chatted with the lady, and endeavored to study
her.</p>
<p>Darrell thought that if his suspicions were proven true,
Lillian Leslie must be the perfection of an actress&mdash;he had
never seen two such <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>extremes meet in an
individual&mdash;she was the incarnation of good and evil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, are you acquainted with a Mrs. Collingwood
of your street here?&rdquo; he asked after a while, in a careless
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked surprised, as though wondering where he could have
met her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Last night I made her acquaintance.&nbsp; She is
accounted a rather handsome woman, I believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was put out as a sort of feeler, for he had not even seen
her face.</p>
<p>Lillian answered in a manner that declared what little
interest she had in the lady:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe so, but we were never friends, and I do not
know much about the lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That ended it.</p>
<p>Darrell soon took his leave, having gained the point for which
he had come.</p>
<p>When he entered a car on the elevated road he found a corner
to himself, and then, unable to wait longer, proceeded to compare
the two notes.</p>
<p>Just as he thought, the writing was of the same order, and
there was much resemblance in the capital letters.</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>Still, Eric had seen enough to know that only an expert
could decide this question beyond all cavil.</p>
<p>Before now he had seen the chirography of two persons resemble
each other, and this was not to be accepted as conclusive
evidence.</p>
<p>At the same time it was a point that would bear upon the final
result.</p>
<p>He kept it in mind.</p>
<p>Other threads must now be taken up in turn, until the main
current was reached which would sweep him on to the sea.</p>
<p>He put away the document just received from Mrs. Leslie.</p>
<p>While still looking at the other, some one sat down beside
him.</p>
<p>Darrell&rsquo;s thoughts were fixed upon the subject which
occupied his attention, and he did not even know there was some
one in the next seat until a hand clutched his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did you get that paper?&rdquo; said a hoarse
voice close by his ear.</p>
<p>Turning his head at this he was surprised to see Paul Prescott
beside him.</p>
<p>Fortune plays some queer tricks at times, and this was one of
them.</p>
<p><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>What
an odd chance that this man, of all in the great city, should sit
down in the same car, at the very moment Darrell had that fatal
paper in his hand.</p>
<p>The circumstances were indeed so singular that Eric could not
but start; but his excellent control over his nerves stood him in
good stead again.</p>
<p>He looked in the artist&rsquo;s face&mdash;it was flushed and
eager and angry&mdash;evidently he had not missed the letter up
to now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, does it belong to you?&rdquo; asked the
detective, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then take your property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, sir; but I have a right to ask, yes, demand
of you, to explain under what peculiar circumstances this
document chanced to come into your possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not question your right to ask that, and I shall
readily tell where and when I picked the letter up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So he gave the time and place to a dot, but did not say
anything about having seen it drop from the pocket of the
owner.&nbsp; Prescott remembered that this was when and where he
had <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>received the message, and he had no doubt of the truth
of the story.</p>
<p>At the same time he looked at the man by his side with a
frown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You read this?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Naturally so&mdash;you could not blame me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And had your curiosity aroused?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, yes, but that has nothing to do with it.&nbsp;
Let us forget the circumstance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Willingly, since it concerns the private affairs of a
very dear friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No more was said.</p>
<p>Eric read his paper and the artist seemed occupied with his,
but every now and then he turned his eyes toward the detective as
though his curiosity was aroused.</p>
<p>When the artist arose at Fourteenth Street, to leave the car,
Eric handed him a card he had prepared for such occasions.</p>
<p>It gave his name and the address of his
apartments&mdash;nothing more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you should ever desire to see me, sir, you will find
me there by letter or person,&rdquo; he said quietly.</p>
<p>At this Prescott smiled broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t think I dream of sending <a
name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>you a
challenge for finding my letter,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you looked as black as a thunder cloud, and I
didn&rsquo;t know but what you might be meditating something of
the sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was rude in me to act that way, and I beg your
pardon for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Frankly said.</p>
<p>The detective liked him better for it, and there was something
about the other&rsquo;s face quite attractive after all.</p>
<p>Somehow Eric did not seem to hate and despise him as he had
done before.</p>
<p>When the artist had gone he fell into a fit of musing
again.</p>
<p>Various theories were built up, only to be discarded again as
unequal to the occasion.</p>
<p>He remembered that the letter had been given to Prescott by a
woman, who was evidently in the pay of the party signed L.</p>
<p>Whom could Lillian send?</p>
<p>He did not know the internal arrangements of the lovely little
house up town, and this was what was now on his mind.</p>
<p>The office of Joe Leslie was his destination, and he made his
way thither after leaving the elevated road.</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>Leslie was in John Street, and carried on a business in
precious stones, of which he was one of the best judges in the
city.</p>
<p>He was a man of considerable wealth, but being of an
unostentatious nature he did not put on much style, preferring to
live quietly and well.</p>
<p>When Eric Darrell ascended the stairs of the large building in
which his friend had his offices, he was forcibly reminded of
times gone by when Joe was a bachelor, and the two had been warm
friends, passing through numerous scenes of pleasure in
company.</p>
<h2><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">COMPARING NOTES</span></h2>
<p>Joe was in.</p>
<p>When the detective sent his card by the same clerk whom he had
helped Joe rescue from the clutches of the gamblers, he was shown
to the private office.</p>
<p>Here he found his friend seated at his desk, and busily
engaged with a pile of letters that had come in the morning
mail.</p>
<p>Joe greeted him cordially and begged him to wait a few
minutes, when he would be through with his task.</p>
<p>This suited the detective exactly, since it gave him a chance
to watch the other.</p>
<p>He was able to read a face pretty thoroughly and he saw very
quickly that Joe was still greatly troubled in his mind.</p>
<p>He had gotten rid of one burden, but another had come in its
stead.</p>
<p>What could it mean?</p>
<p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 172</span>There
was little need for Eric to ask that.</p>
<p>He knew, beyond all doubt, that the old suspicions had arisen
again in Joe&rsquo;s mind, perhaps strengthened by some
circumstance.</p>
<p>Finally Joe leaned back in his chair and looked at his
visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, for a short time last night I was really and
truly happy&mdash;it seemed to me that the clouds had all rolled
by.&nbsp; Then, by a strange circumstance, they were brought
forward again and now I am worse off than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is too bad&mdash;I am sorry for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before, it was my foolish habit that gave me
sorrow&mdash;now it is a dreadful thought that I endeavor to
banish from my mind, but which rises up again and again in all
its hideous deformity until I almost feel as though I am mad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still I keep my thoughts clear, for I know that this
awful question must be grappled with, and fought to the
death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My whole future is concerned in it, and I mean to lay
the ghost forever, or else know the very worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spoken like a true man, Joe.&nbsp; Shake hands on that
as a bargain.&nbsp; I am, in this matter, hoping to prove your
wife&rsquo;s innocence, but I <a name="page173"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 173</span>shall take up any evidence that
comes along, and apply it where it belongs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want you to, old fellow, no matter what the pain it
brings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To begin with, you know all my hopes are to the end
that Lillian may prove to be as innocent as a babe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven grant it,&rdquo; Joe groaned.</p>
<p>His tone betokened despair.</p>
<p>The detective judged from this that his friend must have made
some discovery since last they met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time, Joe, you know as it looks at present,
things are decidedly against your wife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I try to deceive myself, Eric, into the belief that it
is not so, but I cannot, I cannot.&nbsp; She shall have a fair
trial&mdash;I will give her the advantage of every doubt, and
then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He could not finish the sentence.</p>
<p>Poor fellow! how Eric pitied him, and in that moment,
believing Lillian guilty, cursed the hour she ever crossed
Joe&rsquo;s path, to blight a life devoted to her.</p>
<p>Never mind&mdash;the end was not yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what you have discovered, Eric,&rdquo; <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>said
Leslie, throwing off the terrible feeling that almost overcame
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After you, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know I have anything to tell?&rdquo; in a
surprised tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your looks give it away.&nbsp; Proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, being encouraged to speak, Joe gave a brief account of the
charming scene that had taken place in his home on the preceding
night.</p>
<p>Eric was quite interested, and his reflections upon the little
woman were flattering to her.</p>
<p>Then came the climax.</p>
<p>The note with the charred edge was produced, and submitted to
examination.</p>
<p>Eric looked upon it as furnishing quite a link in the chain of
evidence&mdash;he believed the secret referred to must indeed
mean that which they were looking up.</p>
<p>When Joe heard the opinion of his friend, he was not much
encouraged&mdash;indeed, his spirits were reduced to a lower ebb;
but he shut his teeth and said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I want your opinion, Joe, as a man of some legal
acumen.&nbsp; It is a little question I desire to have
settled,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>With that he took out the document he had received from
Lillian.</p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>&ldquo;You recognize the handwriting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do&mdash;it is my wife&rsquo;s,&rdquo; with a
shiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had another paper, but gave it up to the owner; but,
as it fortunately turned out, ere doing so I traced the signature
with a piece of tracing paper&mdash;see, here it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put the two together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bend over, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want me to decide?&rdquo; nervously, as
might a man who feared lest his words might convict one he
loved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Examine these signatures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If asked your opinion frankly as an outsider, would you
incline to the belief that one hand had made both of
these?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You insist on a reply?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you had better give it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, according to my humble opinion, those letters are
alike, and the chances are decidedly in favor of the same party
having made both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My opinion exactly&mdash;I would not swear to it but I
put the chances in that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he turned the paper over to Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of this?&rdquo; asked that worthy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing out of the way in it.&nbsp; I only <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>had your
wife write it out and sign her initials in order to compare it
with the other document.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will reproduce it, word for word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drawing some paper to him he wrote rapidly for a few
minutes.</p>
<p>Then he placed the duplicate of Prescott&rsquo;s letter in
front of Joe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This looks like a deep conspiracy, Eric&mdash;you say
this was signed that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it&mdash;in&mdash;her handwriting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were enough points of resemblance to make it
striking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; and he beat his fist against his
forehead in despair&mdash;then recovered his calmness after an
effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say you have lost this document?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had compared them in the elevated coming down here,
and was still looking at that one when a hand was laid on my arm
and a man asked me what I was doing with his property.&nbsp; I
saw he was the owner and gave it over&mdash;we had a few words
and separated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that man known to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By sight, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>Joe
shuddered visibly, as though he understood the suggestive words
of the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it was <i>he</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul Prescott, the artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curses on him for a meddler!&nbsp; Lillian has a
weakness for art, and I have often jokingly told her she should
have married a painter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That explains his power in a measure&mdash;he has fed
her on art and won her regard by posing as a hero.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe struck the duplicate paper fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, you may think me crazy to doubt it, but unless
Lillian declares in my presence that this is the product of her
pen I will never believe it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, my friend, I honor you for such a feeling, and I
hope as I never hoped before in my life that this thing will
prove a false alarm.&nbsp; All the same I shall do my duty by you
every time, as a true friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thousand thanks.&nbsp; I feel fifty years old to-day
instead of thirty-six&mdash;it is my birthday, you know,
Eric,&rdquo; with a sad smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you many happy returns, my dear
fellow&mdash;just three years younger than I am.&nbsp; I wish I
had a gift to give you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best gift this world could give me would <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>be the
proof that my wife is the true and faithful wife I have always
believed her.&nbsp; Great heavens! Eric, when I think of it all,
a spasm comes over me&mdash;my fingers twitch as though they
would love to encircle the throat of that arch-devil and choke
his life out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric was surprised.</p>
<p>He had not believed this of Joe, looking upon the other as a
sort of good-natured giant whom any one could impose upon.&nbsp;
Now he saw him angry he made up his mind that if ever Paul
Prescott and Joe came in contact it would go hard with the
artist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I declare, you will make a modern Othello yet,
Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; with a shudder, &ldquo;I might kill him,
but I would never raise a finger against her if she deceived me
time and again.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t; I must love her
always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every man to his taste.&nbsp; Your character is one in
a thousand, Joe.&nbsp; As for me I confess I have more of the
tiger about me, and if a man or woman foully wrongs me I look
forward with pleasure to revenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let us talk about it&mdash;the worst I
would <a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>do
to her would be to seek a separation&mdash;but for him,&rdquo;
and his face grew grandly dark and gloomy, but he did not
finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to ask you a few questions about your home,
Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place you have a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, two of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What positions do they occupy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is in the kitchen&mdash;the other a sort of
upstairs girl, to take care of the rooms, answer the door, and
wait upon the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Describe the cook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is as fat as she is long, almost, and as
good-natured as she is fat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric made a gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That point is settled.&nbsp; Now the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nanny is a woman too, but much smaller, and ladylike in
her ways.&nbsp; She came here from Chicago with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! a favorite of your wife&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Nanny was in her mother&rsquo;s employ as a
girl.&nbsp; She is faithful to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ahem!&nbsp; Just the person, in fact, to be entrusted
with a message of a secret nature, that must be handed to a
certain party?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>At
this Joe turned red and white by turns.&nbsp; &ldquo;I presume
so,&rdquo; he admitted, uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Nanny about my height, rather slim, and quick in her
actions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dresses in black?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My soul! man, you seem to drive the nails into my
coffin with each question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Answer, Joe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does dress in black&mdash;most maids do in New York
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wear a white apron?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; with a gleam of hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither did this girl.&nbsp; I knew she was a maid by
the courtesy she made when handing Prescott the letter, and also
from the little white cap she wore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Joe&rsquo;s last chance seemed gone&mdash;the other had
knocked away the pins upon which his house was built.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was probably Nanny, but I can not and will not
believe Lillian wrote that note.&nbsp; Some other party had hired
Nanny to give it to that man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell knew Joe was hugging a phantom to his heart, but he
could not take pleasure in <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>arguing with the deceived
husband&mdash;besides, Joe&rsquo;s actions proved that he
believed more than he would admit either to himself or his
confidential adviser, and if the blow did come it would not be
such a terrible shock as if he had received no warning.</p>
<p>The end was not far away.</p>
<h2><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE LOCKED SARATOGA</span></h2>
<p>The detective was not yet through.</p>
<p>He wished to find out a few other things connected with the
case, through information which Joe alone could give.</p>
<p>When the latter had told his story concerning what had
happened at his house on the preceding night, he had touched
lightly on the incident of the closet.</p>
<p>The keen detective had however made a mental note of the
circumstance, and he was bound to know more of the matter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a closet is it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a roomy affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep what there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A number of odds and ends, and I believe a large
Saratoga trunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! your wife&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She brought it from Chicago.&nbsp; On our little <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>trips to
Boston and Washington we used my leather one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this trunk has been there all the
while?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think now&mdash;have you ever known Lillian to enter
that closet for anything since she came to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe turned white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She might have done so dozens of times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But have you known her to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything kept there she would want?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I know of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the circumstances does it not strike you as
singular that she should not only enter the closet but lock it
and take the key upstairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, I have thought so myself,&rdquo; sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Joe, you are withholding something from me that
has a bearing on this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know it?&rdquo; quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps a little bird told me, or else I read the
secret in your face.&nbsp; At any rate you have no business to
keep it from me, I am trying to do my duty&mdash;heaven knows if
I could I would have your wife as spotless as the noonday sky,
and if she proves otherwise I shall lose <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>faith in
all womankind forever; but I must be able to weigh every particle
of evidence for and against her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Eric, but I felt so badly over the
circumstance that I hardly had the heart to relate it to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it is against her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sky grows very black&mdash;poor Joe&mdash;poor
Lillian&mdash;my heart is in sympathy with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe had buried his face in his hands and seemed quite
overcome.</p>
<p>The detective waited.</p>
<p>When his friend had in a measure recovered from the shock, he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now tell me the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe&rsquo;s voice was a little unsteady, but it gained
strength as he proceeded:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I came down this morning it was late for me, but I
had not slept well, and felt a raging headache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lillian was in the library, and left me to go down to
see if she could not have a cup of strong tea made, which always
acts as a sedative with me when I have a headache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My thoughts had never gone from that closet <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>and I had
already seen that the key was in the door for Lillian had brought
it down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hardly had she left the room than I was over there and
had the door open.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I examined the interior but found it all as I had been
in the habit of seeing it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This surprised me.&nbsp; Could I after all have done
her an injustice with my suspicions?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was beginning to think so, when I suddenly noticed a
little thing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The key of her Saratoga trunk was missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remembered seeing it in the trunk a few weeks
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should Lillian take it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Instinctively I tried the lid&mdash;it was
fast&mdash;the trunk was locked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I left the closet, and was sitting in the library when
the breakfast bell rang, and Lillian came in to go down with
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was full of spirits, while I felt as though I were
about to attend my own funeral.</p>
<p>&ldquo;During the progress of the meal I spoke about there
being a chance of our soon going out to Chicago to pay a visit,
and she seemed to be very quiet over it, unusually so, I
believed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;By the way, I miss the key of your
trunk&mdash;<a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>will you let me see if the interior is in good
condition?&rsquo; I said as steadily as I could, although I felt
my face turn red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She looked at me as though surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow you can do so, Joe&mdash;to-day you are in
poor condition for anything.&nbsp; Take your mind off everything
that excites it.&nbsp; I wish you would stay at home to-day and
nurse your headache.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I professed to have business of unusual importance down
town, and shortly after left the house for my office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Eric, give me your honest opinion&mdash;my mind is
hardly in a fit condition to see and judge for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective had listened intently.</p>
<p>He could grasp the threads and draw them into one compact
cord.</p>
<p>The issue was before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, it is beyond all question that her secret lies in
that trunk&mdash;if we knew what it contains, nothing more would
be needed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; rather wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the tenor of the letter Prescott received I am
inclined to believe some one is about to run away with him, or he
with her, rather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joe groaned dismally.</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>&ldquo;If in that trunk I should find some of her
dresses and jewelry&mdash;well, I should be strongly inclined to
believe it meant flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; hoarsely, clutching his throbbing brow
with both hands, &ldquo;not that.&nbsp; Lillian would never be
guilty of that.&nbsp; She may have flirted with the
man&mdash;women are weak, I know&mdash;but that is the worst I
will believe of her&mdash;the worst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Darrell shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Joe, but you must permit me to place my own
estimation on things.&nbsp; My eyes are not blinded by
love&mdash;I can weigh things calmly, and place their right
estimation upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, I said I would leave it all with you and I do,
but until it is proven beyond all doubt, do not ask me to believe
in her guilt.&nbsp; It will kill me if it is so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust in me, Joe, old fellow, I will act for you as
though you were my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;whatever comes, Eric&mdash;be gentle with
Lillian&mdash;let me be the one to&mdash;oh! my God!&nbsp; I
cannot believe it, and yet it seems as though a burning iron were
branding it on my brain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective was done for the present.</p>
<p>From Joe&rsquo;s offices he went to his own.</p>
<p><a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Here
he could sit down and review the situation in regular order.</p>
<p>Darrell generally made notes of his subject, so that he might
ever keep the circumstances before his mind.</p>
<p>He now jotted down a few more headings, and then surveyed the
case as seen through these spectacles which he had drawn on.</p>
<p>Looking over his shoulder we can also get a resume of the case
by reading what he filled up a page in his note book with.</p>
<p>They were arranged under heads in numerical order, beginning
at the start:</p>
<p>1&mdash;Paul Prescott, an artist, makes daily visits to
Joe&rsquo;s house when Joe is down town.</p>
<p>2&mdash;Lillian Leslie has a secret from her husband.</p>
<p>3&mdash;The paper dropped by Prescott is in her writing, and
seems to promise an elopement.&nbsp; It is also signed L, her
initial.</p>
<p>4&mdash;The girl who gave Prescott the letter corresponds with
Lillian&rsquo;s faithful maid, who has been in the family for
many years.</p>
<p>5&mdash;The fact of her having the closet key upstairs is
significant in itself.</p>
<p>6&mdash;Her trunk is locked and the key gone&mdash;<a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>she says
she will produce it when Joe has leisure to examine the
trunk&mdash;there is no hurry&mdash;the morrow will
do&mdash;evidently <i>something</i> is to occur between now and
to-morrow.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>This was the indictment.</p>
<p>Against it, on the opposite page, he had written the
defense&mdash;it came under one head:</p>
<p>&ldquo;1&mdash;Lillian is my ideal of womanly
perfection&mdash;if she prove guilty my faith is gone
forever.&nbsp; I have never yet been able to <i>believe</i> her
guilty while in her presence&mdash;it is only when away that
these terrible facts make me fear it is so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A peculiar case this.&nbsp; If Lillian could plead her own
cause, she would undoubtedly win it.</p>
<p>For a long time Eric Darrell sat and looked at his notes.</p>
<p>They covered about all of the case.</p>
<p>He could not but see how overwhelming the evidence was against
Lillian and how meager her defense.</p>
<p>Still he kept hoping for the best, trusting that something
would turn up to send the balance over to the other side.&nbsp;
Had it been any one other than Lillian, the detective must have
declared that there could be no hope&mdash;the case <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>would be
virtually closed.&nbsp; With such a client, however, he had hope
to the end, because all his sympathies were enlisted in behalf of
Joe and his wife.</p>
<p>He was not the man to waste time in useless speculation, and
when he had calmly reviewed the situation, he made up his mind
what ought to be done.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to save Lillian even though she were
guilty?</p>
<p>He could not face her&mdash;his first thought had been to see
her and speak of the terrible nature of the indictment hanging
over her like the sword of Damocles, suspended by a single
hair&mdash;perhaps she was influenced by some strange power the
artist possessed&mdash;mesmerized, made a slave by some peculiar
phase in a powerful organization&mdash;Eric had known of such
things, although he did not pretend to understand them.</p>
<p>When he came to think it over, however, he concluded that he
could not muster up courage enough to say these things to her
face.</p>
<p>He was certain that, strong-nerved man as he was, he would
utterly fail when he sat opposite those eyes, and felt them upon
him.</p>
<p>Was there any other source to which he might apply?</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>He
ran over the field.</p>
<p>What of Paul Prescott?</p>
<p>The thought seemed absurd at first but presently he began to
realize that there was a chance back of it.</p>
<p>The man was a character and might not be as bad as appearances
indicated.</p>
<p>Perhaps moral suasion might influence him, and in case that
failed a threat would possibly have the desired effect.</p>
<p>The more he thought over the matter the better he looked upon
the idea.</p>
<p>At last he determined to try it.</p>
<p>There could be no harm done.</p>
<p>At the same time he had a chance to accomplish a great
work.</p>
<p>A new thought had entered Eric&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>Even if Lillian was guilty he might through some work,
skillfully arranged, so manage it that the disturbing element
should be removed, and their lives flow on smoothly again.</p>
<p>This was his highest hope.</p>
<p>That he would find Lillian innocent had ceased to enter into
his calculations.</p>
<p>He only hoped for a half way victory.&nbsp; It was noon when
he went out, and stopping in a <a name="page192"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 192</span>restaurant he had dinner.&nbsp; His
plan was arranged.</p>
<p>If he could effect a meeting with the artist, the worst would
soon be known, and he would also discover what sort of man
Prescott was.</p>
<p>He knew where the latter had his studio, and presently was
bound for Fourteenth Street to interview the artist.&nbsp; What
would come of that interview no one could tell, but Eric hoped
for a favorable issue.</p>
<p>At any rate he did not think his case would be destroyed by
what he was now about to undertake.</p>
<p>At half past one he entered the building where Paul Prescott
had his studio.</p>
<p>A few minutes later he stood at the door and gave a loud
knock.</p>
<h2><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE ARTIST IS DEFIANT</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Come in!&rdquo; said a voice.</p>
<p>Eric opened the door.</p>
<p>An odor of tobacco greeted him.</p>
<p>Prescott, in his studio dress, was before a painting, putting
some touches here and there.</p>
<p>So interested was he that he did not turn his head when the
door closed.</p>
<p>Darrell looked at the painting and was charmed&mdash;it was a
glimpse of the Delaware Water Gap, and so true to nature that one
could almost believe he was on the spot.</p>
<p>Finally the artist stepped back a pace.&nbsp; &ldquo;There!
that is done.&nbsp; I beg your pardon&mdash;&rdquo; and he
wheeled around.</p>
<p>As he saw who his visitor was he uttered an exclamation of
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darrell.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>&ldquo;To what do I owe the pleasure of this visit, Mr.
Darrell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Evidently he was inclined to be a little suspicious of the man
who had had that letter in his possession.</p>
<p>At the same time his curiosity was aroused.&nbsp; Eric saw
this.&nbsp; He was ready to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>Coolly seating himself he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Prescott, I have called to see you in reference to
that paper which you received from my hands this
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! indeed,&rdquo; with a frown.</p>
<p>Not at all dismayed the detective went on: &ldquo;I believe
you claimed it as your property?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did&mdash;have you any reason to doubt my
word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, sir.&nbsp; If it was your property, then
the letter must have been addressed to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Prescott, you are looked upon in society as an
honorable man&mdash;your name has never yet been tarnished.&nbsp;
As a friend I beg of you to pause ere you cross the
Rubicon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this about?&nbsp; It seems to me you
are interesting yourself in a business that does not concern you
in the least,&rdquo; coldly.</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>&ldquo;That is where you are mistaken, sir&mdash;it
does interest me greatly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the lady who wrote that note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The artist shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric was somewhat surprised.</p>
<p>He had expected that the man would show signs of
consternation.</p>
<p>On the contrary he maintained his self-possession, and even
smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You contemplate a step that is bound to bring
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not my fault,&rdquo; with a sneer; &ldquo;some
people are so wrapped up in themselves that they can see no one
else.&nbsp; This lady&mdash;her name shall not be mentioned, as I
would not have it the subject of a quarrel&mdash;prefers my
company to that in which circumstances have thrown her.&nbsp; She
is restrained of her liberty, and I would give it to her.&nbsp;
That is all.&nbsp; Through the interference of some interloper,
such as yourself, we may be prevented from carrying our immediate
plans into execution, but the postponement can only be
temporary.&nbsp; We must triumph!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric was more than ever amazed.</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>This
man did not appear shamefaced&mdash;he even gloried in his foul
work.</p>
<p>Surely this was the acme of villainy.</p>
<p>How was he to meet it?</p>
<p>Could he cow the artist?</p>
<p>Already he had made up his mind that this was impossible, for
the man seemed to be as daring as he was bad.</p>
<p>What then?</p>
<p>There was nothing left but to let the game take its
course.</p>
<p>If Joe and this man ever came into personal contact there
would be trouble, for the artist looked like a man who would back
up his acts with blows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You refuse to change your plans, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most decidedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you may rue it ere long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, what makes it your business&mdash;there was
no name attached to this note&mdash;how do you know who wrote
it&mdash;what in the devil have you got to do with it, anyhow,
and what is to hinder me from giving you a sound thrashing on
account of your confounded impudence in the affair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His manner was threatening.</p>
<p><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>Eric
did not wince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Prescott, listen to me, I am a man not acquainted
with fear, nor do I descend to fisticuffs.&nbsp; You see I am
armed&mdash;now you can keep your distance and talk reason or
else take the consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At sight of the revolver the artist started.</p>
<p>He seemed to suspect for the first time what manner of man he
was dealing with.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a&mdash;detective?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In <i>his</i> employ?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr.&mdash;the gentleman referred to is an old friend of
mine.&nbsp; I have sworn to see him through this
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you following me when this paper fell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw it drop?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the maid who gave it&mdash;perhaps you followed her
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No matter&mdash;I believe I know all there is to be
known of this affair, sir.&nbsp; I am here to advise you to drop
it before you get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to hear my opinion of you,
sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>&ldquo;It would in no wise alter the one I hold of you,
Mr. Prescott.&nbsp; Still it is not my plan to indulge in
personalities.&nbsp; Remember that what I do is done as a
business and from friendship.&nbsp; I wrong no honest man and
deceive no trusting woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me out a scamp, which I am not, in my own
estimation,&rdquo; he said hotly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is another subject which we need not discuss, sir,
since our ideas would be sure to be at variance.&nbsp; You go
your way and I go mine; but at the last I wish to distinctly warn
you that we are prepared to give you your deserts if you persist
in your course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can go to the man who employs you and tell him for
me that Paul Prescott defies him, and will fight him to the
end!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was strange language&mdash;there was certainly nothing
cringing here.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good.&nbsp; Your blood be on your own head.&nbsp;
You are watched when you least expect it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful you don&rsquo;t go too far and get
hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bah!&nbsp; I was in that opium den last night and saw
the tragedy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prescott started at this, and looked uneasy.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>&ldquo;I was the man who took charge of the remains of
that unfortunate lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible&mdash;I never suspected I had seen you
previous to our meeting in the car.&nbsp; What did you
accomplish?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing I desired.&nbsp; The world will never know
that lady died anywhere but in her own house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have done a good thing, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We detectives are employed to do deeds of mercy as well
as those of justice and duty.&nbsp; I bid you good day, Mr.
Prescott.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had nothing more to say.</p>
<p>The man was not one to argue with, and having made up his mind
all the powers of heaven and earth could not change it.</p>
<p>This Eric read on his face, and saw in his
manner&mdash;Prescott was as stubborn as a mule in all he
undertook, which perhaps in a measure accounted for his
success.</p>
<p>The detective was disappointed.</p>
<p>He had hoped for much and gained nothing, since the other was
so set in his ways as to be defiant.</p>
<p>As Darrell had said there was nothing left now but to let
matters run their course.</p>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>The
puzzle had become deeper than ever to him, and he now accepted it
without any very strong attempt at solving the enigma.</p>
<p>He could not understand how Lillian could love such a man as
Prescott in preference to her husband, except on the theory that
the artist possessed some terrible power over her which she was
incapable of resisting.</p>
<p>Sadly he left the building.</p>
<p>The game must go on now to the inevitable
conclusion&mdash;some one would get hurt, but that was to be
expected.</p>
<p>What he regretted most of all was the shock to poor Joe.</p>
<p>Strange how such an honest, good fellow, making a husband
beyond all reproach, should be thus afflicted.</p>
<p>It often happens in life.&nbsp; Then men who deserve little
are given wives a thousand times too good for them.</p>
<p>All are not mated who are married, any more with regard to
their character than in their stature&mdash;we often see a little
man and a tall woman going along arm in arm and smile as we think
how incongruous it seems, never reflecting that their natures may
be more in harmony than the well-mated pair ahead.</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>The
detective believed that the guilty couple had some plan matured,
and that they meant to make their flight that night.</p>
<p>Indications pointed to it.</p>
<p>He resolved then, to checkmate them, and make the thing a
failure.</p>
<p>Under no condition should Lillian be allowed to go forth.</p>
<p>Eric endeavored to picture Joe&rsquo;s wife in her confusion,
when the mask was torn off.</p>
<p>Would she prove a firebrand?</p>
<p>He did not believe it.&nbsp; It seemed utterly impossible for
a sweet, mild-mannered little woman like Lillian to develop into
a fury.</p>
<p>No doubt, when she found that her secret was known, she would
collapse in a heap at the feet of her husband, and he&mdash;well,
Eric believed Joe was fool enough to take her in his arms and
forgive her.</p>
<p>How could he learn what their plans were?</p>
<p>He was thus pondering when he saw a figure in front of him
that he thought he recognized.&nbsp; It was the trim maid who had
given Prescott the note before.</p>
<p>Of course Eric might be mistaken&mdash;there were many other
like maids besides Mrs. Leslie&rsquo;s <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>particular,
but having the subject in his mind he jumped to the conclusion
that this must be the same party he had seen before.</p>
<p>She was walking along slowly, looking up at the numbers of the
great buildings as if searching for a particular one.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly she was looking for the building in which the
artist had his studio.</p>
<p>Quick as a flash a plan came into the detective&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<p>What should she be looking for Prescott for but to deliver a
note?</p>
<p>He intercepted her.</p>
<p>When he saw her face he discovered that she was an exceedingly
youthful looking person to be about thirty years of age, as Joe
had declared&mdash;had he been asked to guess it he would have
said seventeen.</p>
<p>Appearances are deceitful, however, especially when women are
concerned.</p>
<p>As he came face to face with the girl, he smiled&mdash;she did
not look offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, but are you looking for the office
of Paul Prescott?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She seemed surprised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>&ldquo;Because I am a friend of his with authority to
receive the note you have and keep it for him.&nbsp; I presume it
is from the same party as the one you gave him last
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know about that, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course&mdash;I saw it.&nbsp; Give me the note and
tell the lady Paul has it, as he will in half an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The note, girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She met his eyes, placed a note in his hand and turning sped
away, while the detective chuckled to think what a cunning little
god Fortune was after all.</p>
<h2><a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">FORTUNE&rsquo;S FAVORS</span></h2>
<p>At least luck favored him and Eric could not say anything
against the sudden whirl of the wheel that had left him in such
an advantageous position.</p>
<p>He was naturally anxious to scan the note he held and learn
its contents.</p>
<p>Looking around he saw a candy and ice cream saloon near by,
where many ladies and few gentlemen passed in.</p>
<p>He believed, as the fall day was warm, that he could enjoy a
plate of cream, so he entered, selecting a table in a corner that
was isolated.</p>
<p>Here he gave his order, and while enjoying his cream opened
the note.</p>
<p>It was sealed in the envelope, but the gum had stuck poorly,
and he could easily open it with his knife blade.</p>
<p>Once the contents lay open before him he read: &ldquo;To-night
then it shall be.&nbsp; We are to have <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>company at
our house.&nbsp; I cannot get my trunk out without arousing his
suspicions so I have sent everything to the place you named in
packages by my maid.&nbsp; Have the carriage around the
corner.&nbsp; I will slip out while the gayety is at its height,
meet you at the door and in a minute we will be beyond his
reach.&nbsp; He has been cruel to me, I fear him, and yet I love
you, Paul, and will be yours forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time no signature.</p>
<p>The writer was learning caution.</p>
<p>Even initials might be dangerous.</p>
<p>As for Eric, he read this note over again with the deepest
pain and surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She means to leave him&mdash;there is no doubt of that,
but what can she have reference to when she speaks of his
cruelty?&nbsp; Joe cruel&mdash;Joe, the kindest, mildest, dearest
fellow, I ever knew.&nbsp; He could only be cruel by
kindness.&nbsp; Either he has done too much for her, or else she
is not in her right mind.&nbsp; If that man is cruel then
Prescott is a devil, I&rsquo;m sure.&nbsp; I would that the
writer of this could find out the truth&mdash;it would serve her
well if we let her go on and reap as she has sown but for the
sake of my poor friend she must be saved.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>He
took out an old envelope and with a pencil copied the note
verbatim.</p>
<p>Then he enclosed the original in the envelope, sealed it up,
saw that the address was correct, and was ready to have it
delivered.</p>
<p>When he issued forth from the confectionary, he looked about
him until he saw a bright appearing district messenger boy
sauntering along in the manner peculiar to his kind.</p>
<p>This youth he beckoned to his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you spare five minutes, boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other grinned and nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make it up later, mister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; Here is a note, it is to be taken to
the top floor of this number and delivered into the hands of Mr.
Prescott, the artist.&nbsp; You can take the elevator
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are to tell him a girl dressed in black and wearing
a little maid&rsquo;s cap on her head gave you the
note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine looking&rsquo; maid you are, mister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind&mdash;do as I say.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
fifteen cents.&nbsp; If you come and report to me the result, I
have a quarter more for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m off like the limited
express.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>So
saying he took note and money and plunged into the building with
hot haste, determined to win the prize offered.</p>
<p>Eric waited patiently.</p>
<p>He knew he would see the boy again.</p>
<p>That silver quarter would serve as a magnet to draw him back
to the spot.</p>
<p>Eric had not studied human nature thus long without being able
to guess certain things, and in this instance his surmise proved
correct.</p>
<p>Before the ten minutes had elapsed he saw the messenger boy
come flying along in a way that must have amazed any person who
had grown accustomed to the usual methods of these lads.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are, sir.&nbsp; Right side up with care.&nbsp;
Found him in, and delivered the note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The grin on the boy&rsquo;s face declared also that he had
been paid for his work by the artist, but this was none of
Eric&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>He took out a quarter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here now, boy, I want you to prove what you
say.&nbsp; What did you do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knocked on the door&mdash;a cove opened it&mdash;asked
him if Paul Prescott was in&mdash;said as how he was the
same&mdash;handed him the letter&mdash;he <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>opened it,
grinned, and gave me a shiner.&nbsp; Then I vamosed the ranch and
came to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he ask you where you got it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told him the girl in black racket, which was really
the worst I ever heard, but the fellow seemed to swallow it
without question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Describe the gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the crucial test.</p>
<p>The boy obeyed without hesitation, and speedily proved that he
must have seen and conversed with the artist himself.</p>
<p>After that Eric had no good reason for longer withholding the
promised reward, which was quickly stowed away in the lad&rsquo;s
pocket.</p>
<p>The artist&rsquo;s interview had not resulted in all that he
expected, but he could not say it had been barren of
profit.&nbsp; Then again what followed had made up in a measure
for his defeat.</p>
<p>He knew the enemy&rsquo;s plans.</p>
<p>Thus it would not be such a tremendous job to defeat
them.&nbsp; Should Joe know?</p>
<p>He believed it would be policy to put him on his guard, and in
that way the plotting of the enemy would prove less
profitable.&nbsp; So it was to end to-night.</p>
<p>A carriage was to be in waiting at the corner, <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>and while
Joe&rsquo;s attention was taken up with entertaining his guests,
his wife would slip out and meet her lover.</p>
<p>Here was a chance for a little diplomacy.</p>
<p>For instance, perhaps it could be arranged that the real
Prescott be kidnapped or otherwise kept out of the way, while Joe
dressed himself up to resemble the other.</p>
<p>Then he could carry off his own wife, and at the proper time
reveal his identity, and teach her a terrible lesson.</p>
<p>That would all be decidedly picturesque and highly dramatic,
but there were a number of obstacles to it that would have to be
overcome ere they could accomplish the best result.</p>
<p>These difficulties were of such a nature that it seemed as
though they could not be overcome.</p>
<p>Darrell cast around him to see whether there was not some
other means handy.</p>
<p>How would it do to have the artist arrested on some charge
when on the way to the place of meeting?</p>
<p>He decided against this on the spot, for it was very apt to
make the whole affair public gossip for the newspapers, something
Joe would rather cut off his right hand than have occur.</p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>Next
in order he thought that Lillian might be given something to make
her sleepy or have such a headache that she could never carry out
her part of the arrangement; but this was offensive to his
official taste&mdash;he felt as though it was retreating before
the attack, and it was not his intention to do this.</p>
<p>Finally he decided to see Joe&mdash;perhaps the other would
suggest something that might open up a plausible
scheme&mdash;some little hint dropped in conversation would give
Eric the clew he was looking for.</p>
<p>Joe was still in his office.</p>
<p>He looked surprised to see his friend, and yet made no
remark.</p>
<p>In spite of his effort to appear cheerful, the keen eye of the
detective could see the traces of acute suffering in his
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to see that man, Joe,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought it might be best for all concerned if I
could shame him into giving up his design.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was too bad, Eric, I would have forbidden it had I
known your intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it.&nbsp; The thought came to me after I had
seen you.&nbsp; I am sorry now I went.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>&ldquo;You failed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did indeed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, don&rsquo;t be afraid to tell me.&nbsp; You see
I&rsquo;m calm and collected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric could not but notice this, but he did not like it.</p>
<p>In his mind it seemed like the awful stillness that precedes
the hurricane.</p>
<p>He had no excuse for withholding anything so he told Joe what
had occurred.&nbsp; &ldquo;That man is an accomplished
scoundrel,&rdquo; the other said, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe that myself, but don&rsquo;t be afraid of our
not mastering him.&nbsp; I discovered one of his weak points
after leaving him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trust you for that&mdash;what was it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric proceeded to tell of his adventure.&nbsp; &ldquo;Show me
the duplicate,&rdquo; said Joe, trembling with emotion.</p>
<p>When he had hastily read the copy Darrell had made, he uttered
a low cry of despair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, it is so,&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are to have company to-night.&nbsp; It is my
birthday, as I told you, and my wife said she had invited a few
relatives and friends in to <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>spend the evening&mdash;an informal
affair with a little supper of coffee, cakes and ice cream.&nbsp;
Yes, it is all a deep-laid scheme&mdash;and on my birthday
too.&nbsp; Oh! Lillian, my wife, how could you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His arms lay upon the table, and he let his head fall heavily
upon them.</p>
<p>Eric turned to the window and smoked his cigar in silence.</p>
<p>He had the deepest respect for the grief of his
friend&mdash;it was the keenest misery a human soul can meet here
below&mdash;death causes many pangs, but not the bitter blank
that comes when one is betrayed by the individual he or she had
been ready to die for.</p>
<p>Yes, from the hour the base Judas betrayed his loving Master,
human misery has never known a lower depth than this.</p>
<p>For five minutes Joe fought his battle all alone, and then he
looked up.</p>
<p>His face was set and calm, as though he had conquered
again.</p>
<p>It was a bitter struggle and wearing upon him but he must go
through to the end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, I am ready to converse again.&nbsp; Pardon my
weakness, old friend, but this is a cruel business.&nbsp; I did
not think I was such a baby.</p>
<p><a name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
213</span>&ldquo;Baby!&nbsp; Great heavens! man, you bear it
twice as well as I could.&nbsp; Such a thing would have murdered
me outright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They began talking again.</p>
<p>Eric spoke of his unformed plans, and between them they began
to patch up a scheme by means of which the end they sought would
be attained without publicity.</p>
<p>What it was we shall not disclose just now, leaving that for
the proper time.</p>
<p>At any rate it seemed to give poor Joe some satisfaction to
think he was able to circumvent the villain who had destroyed his
peace of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, it might be better for me to challenge that
man, and kill him,&rdquo; he said moodily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, or leave Lillian a widow, at the mercy of any
adventurer.&nbsp; Besides, in that way the whole dreadful story
would get into the papers, and you could not live in New York
even if that artist failed to murder you.&nbsp; No, you will find
that the plan we have arranged is the best after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are undoubtedly right, Eric&mdash;consider it
settled, and prepare to carry it out.&nbsp; We will end this
agony this night and that devil shall learn what he risks in
attempting to steal another man&rsquo;s treasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
214</span>&ldquo;You will not fail me, Joe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It shall be the effort of my life, Darrell, to
succeed.&nbsp; Have no fears of me&mdash;my pride has been
aroused.&nbsp; It is not the weak lover but the outraged husband
who speaks now.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
215</span>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE TIME DRAWS NEAR</span></h2>
<p>For once Joe Leslie was thoroughly aroused, and the detective
knew he need have no fears of him again.</p>
<p>Whatever he was given to do he would carry out to the
letter.</p>
<p>So they noted with something of satisfaction that the day was
drawing to a close, and the night coming on, for their hour could
not be reached until darkness had for some time settled down over
the great city.</p>
<p>Both were anxious to have the thing over.</p>
<p>It did not give them much pleasure, and all their satisfaction
arose in the thought that justice and right would triumph when
the man who had plotted against the peace of a home went down
among his idols of clay.</p>
<p>In these modern days men have to do strange things when the
sanctity of their house has been invaded by a human serpent.</p>
<p><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>Sometimes the stern arm of the law is called upon for
assistance.</p>
<p>Now and then, however, we read of some outraged husband going
back to old time principles and being a law unto himself on such
an occasion.</p>
<p>Long ago they had a means of avenging such wrongs by meeting
in the lists with lance or sword&mdash;in short, fighting a
duel.</p>
<p>The modern way is perhaps the best if least chivalric since it
is all in favor of the man who has been wronged, and does not
risk his life.</p>
<p>We have seen that Joe was not modern in his ways.</p>
<p>The last thing he desired on earth was to make his misery
public.</p>
<p>His love for his wife was wonderful&mdash;he only blamed the
man who had gained such power over her mind as to make her
irresponsible.&nbsp; Just as though there were wizards
to-day&mdash;the times of Salem witchcraft have not returned to
haunt us again, thank heaven.</p>
<p>Joe really did believe&mdash;and the shrewd detective allowed
the same idea to permeate his own mind to a certain
extent&mdash;that it was a case where a weak mind was dominated
by a masterful one.&nbsp; <a name="page217"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 217</span>He had known such cases, and seen
examples of hypnotism that had astonished him.</p>
<p>Thus he excused Lillian.</p>
<p>While Eric did not go that far, he believed there were
extenuating circumstances connected with the case, and was
willing to look upon it all in a most lenient way.</p>
<p>Probably he would have acted in a different manner had it been
his own wife who was concerned in the affair.</p>
<p>That was a matter that brought the business down to mere
speculation, and when it reached this point it became
unprofitable.</p>
<p>When the detective left his friend he had everything
arranged.</p>
<p>As far as human sight could see beyond, all was ready for the
business in hand.</p>
<p>Should Paul Prescott attempt to put his little game into
practice he would find himself brought up rather suddenly.</p>
<p>There was an hour or so of daylight left, and this Eric put to
good advantage, as he had a number of little things to do.</p>
<p>One cannot engage to carry out a scheme like this without many
accessories being needed, and the wise man looks for these before
the time arrives for their use.</p>
<p><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>Gradually the day gave way to evening.&nbsp; Darrell
believed all was arranged.</p>
<p>He felt satisfied that before another day came around,
Joe&rsquo;s condition would be changed&mdash;this night was the
crisis&mdash;either his spirits must go down or else rise
suddenly.</p>
<p>All depended on one person.</p>
<p>This was Lillian.</p>
<p>To him she was the one object that could affect his
future&mdash;the lodestone that drew him on.</p>
<p>When he had made his preparations and eaten a light supper
down town, Eric started for the scene of the coming comedy.</p>
<p>He could not pierce the future any more than any other human,
and hence knew not whether it would remain such or prove to be a
tragedy.</p>
<p>Coming events may often cast their shadows before, but there
are times when the sun is so nearly in the zenith that this
shadow does not amount to very much.</p>
<p>Besides, what does a shadow amount to anyhow&mdash;it is not
tangible, and presents no opportunity for solution.</p>
<p>For once at least in his life the detective confessed himself
unable to insure the future.</p>
<p><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>He
knew certain facts, and that others would coalesce, but what the
result would be he did not pretend to be chemist enough to
decide.</p>
<p>Time alone would tell.</p>
<p>That was the physician who could be depended upon to bind up
broken hearts, to solve the deepest mysteries and set everything
right.</p>
<p>Given time, nothing was impossible.</p>
<p>As the shades of evening descended, Darrell brought up in the
neighborhood of the building on Fourteenth Street where the
artist&rsquo;s studio was located.</p>
<p>He was passing slowly by when a hack drove up and stopped at
the curb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Engaged?&rdquo; he asked the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, sir, but I am,&rdquo; returned that
worthy.&nbsp; A jehu always hates to lose a fare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t accommodate me up town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Eighty-fourth and Third Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s face lighted up&mdash;Darrell was
answered&mdash;he saw a chance of doubling his fare.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I reckon the other&rsquo;d make no objection. Pay me
first, and I&rsquo;ll tell him I was taken by you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One, fifty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a murmur the detective handed over the amount,
submitting to be robbed in order to carry out his point.</p>
<p>Of course he was disguised.</p>
<p>No one would for a moment imagine that this old gentleman was
the same athletic individual who had visited Prescott in his
studio, and argued with him over a revolver.</p>
<p>The clocks were striking seven as he entered the hack and made
himself comfortable.</p>
<p>Along the wide pavement hundreds were still hurrying, although
the swarms from all the great stores had long since passed
by.</p>
<p>Presently from out the building the artist came.&nbsp; He
looked worried, and well he might.</p>
<p>When a man sets out to steal another man&rsquo;s wife he risks
a great deal.</p>
<p>It must weigh upon his mind, even the personal danger
involved, though his conscience be free.</p>
<p>Darrell recognized this fact, and did not wonder at the look
of anxiety he saw upon the countenance of the artist.</p>
<p>The latter looked up and down the street ere <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>catching
sight of the hack at the curb.&nbsp; Then a smile came upon his
face.</p>
<p>He walked up to the driver, spoke a few words, frowned when
the other mentioned having another passenger, saw no other
vehicle in sight that he could engage, glanced in at the seeming
old man, and then, grumbling, entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust I have not inconvenienced you, sir,&rdquo;
remarked the old gentleman, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, not at all,&rdquo; replied the artist
courteously, though his manner had belied his words.</p>
<p>They rumbled along.</p>
<p>Block after block was left behind.</p>
<p>It is a long distance from Fourteenth Street up to the point
where they were bound, and when half an hour had gone by they had
not yet reached their destination.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was not far from eight o&rsquo;clock when the
driver pulled up at the corner.</p>
<p>The old gentleman got out slowly.</p>
<p>He bade his traveling companion good night and turning walked
away, his cane beating a lively tattoo upon the stone
pavement.</p>
<p>Darrell was satisfied with his investment thus far&mdash;he
had been carried up town, had seen the <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>artist well
upon his way, and knew both driver and vehicle by sight.</p>
<p>There could not very well be any mistake after this&mdash;he
believed things were well laid out, and that all they needed was
a chance to execute their plan.</p>
<p>He again changed his looks, so that in case the artist saw him
he would not realize that he had met him before.</p>
<p>With the facilities at his command it was not a difficult
thing for him to do this, and by means of a few deft turns he
completely altered his character, and might defy recognition,
even were keener eyes concerned than those of Paul Prescott, the
artist.</p>
<p>When this had been done Darrell walked up the avenue, and soon
came to the corner where, as he expected, he found the
vehicle.</p>
<p>Prescott was not in sight.</p>
<p>Some two hours must elapse before the time arranged would
pass.</p>
<p>The driver had also vanished, no doubt being in a liquor store
near by, where he could wet his whistle, lounge at his ease and
watch his team at the same time.</p>
<p>His horses would have a good chance to rest <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>before they
were needed again, and this was probably one reason why the
artist had him on hand at such an early hour.</p>
<p>When young Lochinvar carried off his bride he managed to have
a good steed, knowing that everything depended on the swiftness
of his flight, as pursuit would be sudden and furious.</p>
<p>So Paul Prescott, with an eye to possible emergencies, had
chosen a vehicle that was drawn by a good team of animals.</p>
<p>He showed his wisdom here.</p>
<p>In case of pursuit it might be his salvation.</p>
<p>When the detective sauntered past the house upon which his
interest was centered he saw that it was lighted up.</p>
<p>Company was expected.</p>
<p>Lillian had invited a few particular friends in to see them,
on account of its being Joe&rsquo;s birthday.</p>
<p>As yet they had not begun to arrive, but would soon appear
upon the scene.</p>
<p>Darrell heard a vehicle coming, and stopped in a dark spot
near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first of the guests,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>As the carriage stopped in front of the house he gave a
start.</p>
<p><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>&ldquo;Jupiter! guests with trunks&mdash;that&rsquo;s
odd.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was a trunk up beside the driver, who at
once leaped to the ground.</p>
<p>As he opened the door a vision of jaunty wraps and bonnets
sprang out and flew up the steps to ring the bell, while Darrell
held his breath as he guessed the truth.</p>
<p>The door opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marian!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flutter of feminine apparel, a little shriek of girlish
delight, and the sisters were locked in each others&rsquo; arms,
to the wonderment of the man who watched below.</p>
<p>Then the jehu carried in the trunk, the door closed, the
carriage rumbled away and the street resumed its wonted
appearance.</p>
<p>Eric was puzzled.</p>
<p>He had not counted on this.</p>
<p>Had any of the others?</p>
<p>What effect would it have on the anticipated elopement, he
wondered.</p>
<p>Here was the lover with his vehicle on hand, and such a nature
as Paul Prescott&rsquo;s would not brook interference.</p>
<p>The affair became more complicated.</p>
<p>Darrell would have given something to have had the next two
hours over.</p>
<p><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>As it
was he had to possess his soul in patience and wait.</p>
<p>Things that he did not dream of were fated to turn up in that
time, and he was bound to have his hands full.</p>
<p>Guests soon began to arrive.&nbsp; Several came in carriages,
while others were not far enough away to bother with
vehicles.</p>
<p>It was no fashionable gathering, but one of warm friends, of
whom Joe Leslie had many.</p>
<p>His business and social life was such that he drew people to
him, making many friends and few enemies, which is after all the
only true way to go through this world.</p>
<h2><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">FOR PLUNDER</span></h2>
<p>At about a quarter to nine Darrell once more sauntered past
the house.</p>
<p>He could see into the parlor, as the inside shutters were
turned, and with a number of others he was attracted by the
bright scene.</p>
<p>Although perhaps he would not confess it, the bachelor
detective was eagerly hoping for even a fleeting glimpse of
Marian.</p>
<p>He got it too.</p>
<p>After having seen the photograph Lillian had shown him, he
knew he could not be mistaken.</p>
<p>The girl stood for half a minute in direct focus from his
place of observation, and the gas-light fell full upon her face
and figure.</p>
<p>Darrell drew in a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
try&mdash;unless this other affair takes the heart out of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had lived between thirty-five and forty years without ever
having a serious love scrape; but <a name="page227"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 227</span>an inward monitor told him his time
had come at last.</p>
<p>The little god plays all manner of pranks with his victims,
and although Eric Darrell had eluded his sway so long, it would
all be made up to him presently.</p>
<p>As Marian stood there she was joined by a second figure.</p>
<p>This was Joe.</p>
<p>Eric scanned his face eagerly, as best he could under the
circumstances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven!&nbsp; Joe is calm.&nbsp; He has aroused
his energies.&nbsp; No danger of his giving out when the crucial
test comes,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>Joe Leslie did appear self-possessed, but it was easy to be
seen that he was not himself this evening.</p>
<p>His wife accounted for it to the friends about her by stating
that Joe had been overworking himself lately, and that morning he
complained of a severe headache.</p>
<p>She did not seem to suspect that she had given him cause for
his breakdown.</p>
<p>None are so blind as those who refuse to see.&nbsp; It might
be this or innocence that caused her to ignore the truth.</p>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>Eric,
with a sigh, passed on.</p>
<p>He had seen Lillian join the others, and the trio gave him a
strange feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So fair, and yet so false.&nbsp; How can a man trust a
woman when he has such a terrible example before his
eyes&mdash;and her sister too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He soon forgot all this.&nbsp; Something else attracted his
attention, and he found that there was need of his care.&nbsp; A
couple of sinister-looking men passed the house and looked
in.</p>
<p>He saw them conversing eagerly together a minute or two later
just beyond.</p>
<p>At first an idea sprang into his head that they might be men
hired by Prescott to create a disturbance and delay pursuit after
the latter had succeeded in reaching his carriage with
Lillian.</p>
<p>If this were so, he must take them into his calculations and
watch them closely.&nbsp; That their conversation concerned the
house where the little gathering was taking place was beyond all
doubt, for their motions attested this.</p>
<p>Then they moved off.</p>
<p>Eric did not believe they had gone, and he followed them with
his eyes.</p>
<p>They slipped into a vacant lot near by, and the detective
began to get a new idea.</p>
<p><a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>Perhaps these fellows were not in the employ of the
artist after all, but skirmishing around on their own hook.</p>
<p>That meant knavery.</p>
<p>He was aroused.</p>
<p>To follow them was his first thought.</p>
<p>Stealing down to the vacant lot he too vanished amid its
blackness.</p>
<p>At first he could see and hear nothing, but in a few minutes
he caught a clew, and found that the two men had gone to the
fence separating the vacant lot from Joe&rsquo;s back yard.</p>
<p>Some old wagons and drays were scattered here and there about
the place, for it presented an admirable wagon yard.</p>
<p>Such is cosmopolitan New York.</p>
<p>The palace often touches the hovel.</p>
<p>Some of the aristocrats up town can look out from their
magnificent houses, and survey the shanty of the squatter built
on the rocks, where the agile goat browses on old shoes and empty
cans.</p>
<p>Some day this will not be, but it is so now, and a source of
wonder to foreigners.</p>
<p>Darrell began to pick his way through the wagon yard, careful
to proceed without noise, <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>for when men are bent upon an
unlawful errand it does not take much of a sound to cause
palpitation of the heart, and he did not want to have their death
on his hands&mdash;just yet.</p>
<p>They seemed to be surveying the scene from the rear.</p>
<p>It was undoubtedly their intention to make some sort of a haul
here.</p>
<p>The silver might be lying around loose, or even some jewelry
in the upper rooms&mdash;men of their trade do not discriminate,
so long as what they seize upon has a specific value.</p>
<p>First, last and all the time, what they want is the cold
cash.</p>
<p>It was certain that they must be frightened away, and that at
once.</p>
<p>His other business was too important to allow him the pleasure
of playing with these fellows, much as he might have enjoyed
it.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances he worked his way close to where
they crouched.</p>
<p>He could hear them working with a chisel or burglar&rsquo;s
tool of some sort&mdash;they were prying off a board from the
fence, so that they might easily pass through when they
desired.</p>
<p>It would be a good route for flight, also, after their object
was attained.</p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>So
interested were they in the task that they did not have the
faintest suspicion of the presence of any one.</p>
<p>Darrell could hear their low words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bill, this here promises to be a lucky strike,&rdquo;
said one, in a low tone.</p>
<p>Bill muttered a reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m of the opinion, Bill, as we&rsquo;ll
have a good whack at some valuables.&nbsp; Ye see, the guests are
all in there&mdash;if we can deceive the gal below and slip
upstairs there ought to be fat pickings for fellers of our
size.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Softly, partner, softly&mdash;there&rsquo;s another in
this here game you ain&rsquo;t counted on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As these words reached their ears, the two men muttered
exclamations of dismay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the deuce is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in thunder is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here.&nbsp; You fellows are treading on
my corns.&nbsp; This is my pasture&mdash;get out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much we won&rsquo;t.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll slit your
wizen first, I reckon.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re in this here game now
for keeps,&rdquo; growled the man named Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must go snacks.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll furnish the
information, and you do the work&mdash;an equalization of
labor&mdash;ain&rsquo;t that fair?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye know, critter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the silver is kept&mdash;it ain&rsquo;t been
brought out yet awhile, and by a little bold work the hull of it
can be spirited away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this the two men can hardly restrain their delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead us to it, and the third is yourn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re on the steal, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready to take anything that counts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the steel I deal in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>One of the men, the fellow nearest him, felt something like a
piece of ice pressed against his left temple.</p>
<p>He put up his hand.</p>
<p>The investigation did not afford him any particular pleasure,
for what he touched sent a shiver through his whole frame.</p>
<p>It was a cold revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move a hand or a foot and you are a dead man.&nbsp; And
you also,&rdquo; to the other fellow.</p>
<p>The board had just come off in this latter chap&rsquo;s arms,
and light from the house poured through the opening in a stream
that was strong enough to show him the situation.</p>
<p>He dared not drop the board, and he was also prevented from
attacking the unknown.</p>
<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>Eric
was master of the situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now see here, men, listen to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead!&rdquo; growled one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In mercy&rsquo;s name don&rsquo;t press that
trigger,&rdquo; groaned the other.</p>
<p>Darrell had to smile at the sudden termination to which
circumstances had brought the bold raid of the two sneak
thieves.</p>
<p>They had come after plunder, but found something more awaiting
them.</p>
<p>The little scheme, concocted on the spur of the moment, had
been driven into obscurity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a detective, watching this house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both men groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fools we was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And although I&rsquo;m going to let you go this time,
if I see either of you here again you&rsquo;ll make a bee-line
for the Tombs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, mister&mdash;if we get off this time
we&rsquo;ll make ourselves scarce.&nbsp; It gives me a chill to
think of Sing Sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to get the chill before you start on such an
expedition, and not after you are caught.&nbsp; You know that
when &lsquo;the devil was sick, the devil a monk would be; but
when the devil got well, the devil a monk was
he&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>&ldquo;Kin we go, mister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;pass out the front door, gentlemen, just as
you came in.&nbsp; And, remember, once goes a long way with
me&mdash;if you show up here again, down you go to Centre
Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank ye, boss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men crept quickly away&mdash;indeed, their haste was
really ludicrous, for they seemed to have a deep-rooted fear lest
he might be tempted to change his mind.</p>
<p>But under the circumstances Eric was quite satisfied to see
them safely off the premises.</p>
<p>His other work would take up his attention, and he could not
expect to amuse himself with such side-shows as these.</p>
<p>He once more made his way to the street.</p>
<p>As before a little knot of curious people stood in front of
the house gazing in.&nbsp; The glimpses they caught of beautiful
women and brave men were a revelation to them.&nbsp; It was like
looking into Paradise.&nbsp; Otherwise the street was quiet.</p>
<p>A train boomed past on the elevated road below.&nbsp; Eric
looked at his watch.&nbsp; It was a quarter past nine.</p>
<p>Three-quarters of an hour still remained, and then would come
the grand climax.</p>
<p><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>He
began to breathe easier, for time was passing, and he felt sure
their plans would come out all right.</p>
<p>Sauntering to the corner he saw the hack still there as he had
left it.</p>
<p>The driver was sitting inside now.</p>
<p>He knew his orders and only waited for the proper time to
arrive.</p>
<p>Where was Prescott?</p>
<p>Eric had expected to see him scouting around the Leslie
mansion, but if the artist was there he had kept his person well
concealed.&nbsp; Not yet had Eric doubted the motives that
brought the other here.</p>
<p>Everything seemed to fit as snugly as though it had been made
for it&mdash;when a carpenter makes a neat job he dove-tails the
corners, and Darrell looked upon the many little things that
connected so wonderfully, as the finishing touches of the
joiner.</p>
<p>If a thunder cloud burst upon him it would certainly take him
unawares, while the cool rain might be very acceptable.</p>
<p>He began to count the minutes.</p>
<p>Seldom had this man ever felt any such thing as nervousness in
his life, but just now he <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>certainly experienced a spell of
it.&nbsp; The minutes seemed hours.</p>
<p>People walked along the street&mdash;he scrutinized every one
as though he expected to see a ghost appear.</p>
<p>In reality he was looking for Prescott.</p>
<p>It worried him to know that the man was somewhere around and
yet out of sight, though he did not doubt but what he would be on
hand when needed.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE COTTAGE BEYOND THE HARLEM</span></h2>
<p>Sometimes things do not run quite as smoothly as we hope
for.</p>
<p>The best laid plans of mice and men often go
wrong&mdash;there&rsquo;s many a slip &lsquo;twixt the cup and
the lip.</p>
<p>So it happened on the present occasion.</p>
<p>It was all owing to a certain clock which had taken a notion
to get ahead of its fellows and was some ten minutes fast.</p>
<p>A lamp set Chicago on fire.</p>
<p>So this unlucky clock upset the beautiful plans of the wily
detective, as he believed, and came near leaving him in the
lurch.</p>
<p>By chance he was down near the corner when suddenly he saw a
female hurrying that way.</p>
<p>A long cloak concealed her figure, but a handsome dress of
white silk peeped below&mdash;a heavy veil had been snatched up
to hide her face and serve in lieu of a hat at the same time.</p>
<p><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>Where
she came from he hardly knew, but a terrible fear almost palsied
him.</p>
<p>It was Lillian!</p>
<p>She had come ahead of time&mdash;Joe would not be ready, and
as a result confusion must ensue.</p>
<p>Luckily the detective was a man able to grasp an
emergency.</p>
<p>He never yet had seen the time when he was so taken by
surprise that his mind refused to do its work.</p>
<p>Just then there was need of quick thought, and action must
follow on its heels.</p>
<p>Hardly had the woman paused upon the corner than a dark figure
sprang out of the shadows near by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Paul!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! you are ten minutes ahead of time,
darling.&nbsp; I would have met you at the place appointed
had&mdash;&rdquo; the rush of a train drowned what else he
said.</p>
<p>Then the detective saw him assist the now shrinking figure
toward the carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be furious,&rdquo; he heard her say, as she
looked apprehensively around, as though anticipating the
appearance of an enraged husband on the scene.</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>If
these were her sensations now, what of the future&mdash;remorse
must soon kill her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had better keep his hands off, or I will teach him a
lesson!&nbsp; The cowardly cur, to bully you so.&nbsp; Enter,
darling&mdash;you are safe with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric&rsquo;s first impulse was for blood.</p>
<p>He felt strongly inclined to spring forward and grapple with
this boaster, who breathed such lies of Joe in his wife&rsquo;s
ears.</p>
<p>Then another thought came.</p>
<p>Such a public scene would immediately collect a crowd at the
corner, and Lillian&rsquo;s name would be dragged in the
dust.</p>
<p>The world has no mercy upon a woman who leaves her husband and
runs away with another man&mdash;the latter loses no caste, but
she, poor creature, can never climb up again.</p>
<p>That is the law of human justice&mdash;woman was given a
nobler, purer nature than man, and when she sins it is
unpardonable.</p>
<p>It has been so ever since the world was, and will be the same
always.</p>
<p>While Eric struggled between what he desired to do and what
policy dictated, the choice was taken from him altogether.</p>
<p>Fate decided.</p>
<p><a name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
240</span>Prescott had placed his charge in the hack and entered
himself.</p>
<p>The driver slammed the door, and mounted nimbly to his
box.</p>
<p>If Eric meant to act it must be now, or the chance was gone
forever.</p>
<p>Already the vehicle was moving.</p>
<p>Now or never!</p>
<p>Obeying a sudden impulse to make the most of a bad bargain, he
ran after the hack.</p>
<p>It had not gained much headway as yet, and Eric caught on
behind.</p>
<p>Here he conceived another one of those sudden fancies, and saw
an opportunity to climb up on top of the vehicle.</p>
<p>Fortunately for his purpose it presented good opportunities
for such gymnastic feats.</p>
<p>No one but a boy or an exceedingly agile man could have
accomplished this thing; but the detective certainly filled the
bill so far as the latter condition was concerned.</p>
<p>He pulled himself up&mdash;his feet secured a hold upon the
springs, and his hands grasped a clutch above.</p>
<p>Then he drew himself upon the top.</p>
<p>A few boys along the pavement noticed this <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>but they
only supposed this was some peculiar way in which a man could
gain a seat beside the driver.</p>
<p>Those inside were too busily engaged in exchanging confidences
to notice anything.</p>
<p>As for the jehu, he was so much taken up with his horses,
avoiding obstructions for which Third Avenue is notorious, that
he never dreamed of the odd passenger he had picked up, until
Eric plumped down on the box beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! where did you drop from?&rdquo; he
ejaculated is dismay, looking up as if he really suspected the
unknown had rained down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry yourself&mdash;I only climbed up over
the back,&rdquo; returned Eric coolly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then just you climb down again in a hurry, or
I&rsquo;ll toss you over,&rdquo; and the man, firing up after his
sudden scare, looked ugly enough to carry his threat into
execution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some other time, old fellow&mdash;just now this place
suits me as well as any, and here I stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rattle of the swiftly moving vehicle over the granite
blocks would prevent any one from hearing this interesting
dialogue&mdash;the parties interested were shouting in each
other&rsquo;s ears.</p>
<p>Perhaps there was something about Eric that <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>aroused a
spirit of animosity in the other; but if so there must also have
been that which warned him to be exceedingly careful.</p>
<p>He showed signs of anger, and yet dared not raise his hand in
open rebellion</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean stealing a ride this
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just because I please.&nbsp; Look down here and
you&rsquo;ll see something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The quarrelsome jehu obeyed.</p>
<p>He looked&mdash;and wilted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jupiter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This man was not the first who ever felt his courage ooze from
his finger ends at sight of a revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understand me,&rdquo; said the detective, sternly,
&ldquo;that is for you if you give me any trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A crazy man escaping&mdash;a burglar at
large!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir, a detective running down his game.&nbsp; We
understand each other, I hope.&nbsp; I want a ride on your
vehicle, and if you give me any trouble I&rsquo;ll land you in
the Tombs double quick as accessory to a murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The word was quite enough.</p>
<p>It blanched the man&rsquo;s cheeks and from that time on the
detective knew he would not have any trouble with him.</p>
<p><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>The
horses were doing their prettiest.</p>
<p>To the surprise of the detective, instead of starting down
Third Avenue, the course was up it.</p>
<p>Evidently then the artist did not mean to go either to his
studio or lodgings.</p>
<p>He had other plans in view.</p>
<p>Now Eric was given a chance to think, and he improved it
well.</p>
<p>So suddenly had this crisis been sprung upon the detective
that he had thus far only acted from impulse.</p>
<p>He must shape some sort of plan, in order to yet win the
game.</p>
<p>Those inside the hack had not the slightest suspicion of his
presence.</p>
<p>The rattle of the vehicle and their own agitation would
prevent their paying any attention to anything happening
outside.</p>
<p>As the night air was cool, all the openings had the glass in
them&mdash;this was another point in the detective&rsquo;s
favor.</p>
<p>No doubt Paul Prescott was thrilled with the great victory he
had won, and believed nothing could keep him from accomplishing
the end toward which he had planned so long, little suspecting
the danger hovering near.</p>
<p><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>On
went the vehicle.</p>
<p>Harlem was gained, that new city that has of late years sprung
up beside the river, a part of New York, and yet really distinct
from it.</p>
<p>Darrell had once more become the cool man as of yore, ready to
grapple with this burning question, and throttle the hydra headed
monster that had crossed the track of Joe Leslie&rsquo;s
wife.</p>
<p>He smiled to think what poor Joe must be doing just
then&mdash;finding Lillian really gone and the detective not on
hand.&nbsp; Had he given the whole thing away?&nbsp; Would all
his guests know that his wife had deserted him for another?</p>
<p>This was a possibility that made Eric grit his teeth and feel
angry at the peculiar chance that had cheated him of his
prey.&nbsp; If things had only worked as they should, the wheels
would have gone along nicely.&nbsp; However, Eric had learned
long ago the folly of crying over spilt milk, and when a disaster
occurred he generally set about retrieving his fortunes as well
as possible.</p>
<p>They were nearing the Harlem.</p>
<p>Would the vehicle cross the bridge and proceed up into the
country beyond?</p>
<p>Pursuit&mdash;it was folly to think of any one being able to
pursue them, at least for some time <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>to come, and a trail grows cold with
waiting.&nbsp; No wonder then the artist felt jolly.</p>
<p>He believed his plan had been a complete success, and that the
prize was his own.</p>
<p>Ah! the Harlem at last.</p>
<p>Those curved lines of lights indicated the bridge that
stretched across.</p>
<p>The horses&rsquo; feet fall upon the planking&mdash;their
course then was over the river.</p>
<p>As for Eric, he was quite indifferent now whither they took
him.</p>
<p>He had made up his mind to see this thing through and to save
Lillian for his friend and it did not matter whether the climax
came to pass in the city or country.</p>
<p>He meant it should be severe.</p>
<p>As Joe Leslie&rsquo;s best friend he would teach this masher a
lesson he would never forget if he survived it.&nbsp; The driver
once or twice tried to strike up a conversation with him, but
Eric ordered him to pay no attention to anything but his
horses.&nbsp; Then a thought coming to him, he told the man that
if the gentleman inside should notice his presence and demand to
know who he was, that the driver should claim him as a friend and
let it pass.</p>
<p><a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>This
the man said he would do&mdash;he had a horror of being concerned
in a murder trial, and this was what the other threatened him
with.</p>
<p>They crossed the bridge and continued on&mdash;houses were
plenty, gas lamps dispelled the darkness at intervals, but at the
same time there seemed to be something of the country about
them&mdash;the great metropolis with its two millions of
inhabitants, its bustle and electric lights lay behind them.</p>
<p>For a short time longer the night ride was continued, and
then, to the satisfaction of the detective, it ended.</p>
<p>They came to a quiet street.</p>
<p>The artist poked his head out of the window which he had
dropped in the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the left&mdash;first house you come to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, there! who the deuce have you with you,
driver?&rdquo; as he caught sight of Eric.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A friend, sir.&nbsp; Thought it&rsquo;d be a lonely
ride back, and took him for company,&rdquo; replied jehu.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was over then, and no damage done.&nbsp; Now for the
next.</p>
<p>The hack drew up in front of a picturesque <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>cottage,
just back from the road&mdash;as far as Eric could see it was
bowered in vines and just the place an artist might be supposed
to select, if he used his artistic taste at all.</p>
<p>Lights were in the rooms.</p>
<p>They must be expected.</p>
<p>Down jumped the driver&mdash;Eric followed close upon his
heels, for he did not mean to give the fellow any chance to
betray him, and he knew it would be human nature for the jehu to
endeavor to warn his liberal patron.</p>
<h2><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ALMOST</span></h2>
<p>Again the detective showed his knowledge of the
animal&mdash;man.</p>
<p>The driver had been thinking of this very thing, and as the
artist came out of the hack first he made a great ado over
helping him.&nbsp; At the same time he started to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better be careful,
sir&mdash;there&rsquo;s&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment came a pinch on his arm from the detective, and
he realized that the other was up to his little game.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Prescott.</p>
<p>By this time Eric had managed to touch one of the jehu&rsquo;s
hands with the barrel of his revolver.</p>
<p>The contact sent a shudder through the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s bad step here&mdash;the lady might be
hurt,&rdquo; finished the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll look after her, my man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He handed the jehu some bills.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s the
<a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>amount
agreed on and ten dollars more, because you&rsquo;ve been
faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, your honor,&rdquo; stammered the man.</p>
<p>He acted as though he was tempted to blurt out the truth and
take the consequences, but Eric managed to whisper something to
him that quieted this suicidal thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your money&mdash;keep quiet, and
I&rsquo;ll put you in the way of ten more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was enough.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s sordid nature was touched&mdash;he was
mercenary to an unusual degree.</p>
<p>After that he was for earning the new fee, even at the expense
of treachery to his former patron.&nbsp; Prescott assisted the
lady companion of his flight out with much solicitude.</p>
<p>Still Eric did not interfere.</p>
<p>He was strongly tempted to knock the artist down, seize the
lady perhaps as she swooned, and placing her back in the vehicle,
drive to the desecrated home of his friend.</p>
<p>Something restrained him.</p>
<p>He would see more.</p>
<p>What meant the lights in the house?&nbsp; Something here
needed investigation, and he was the man to look into it.</p>
<p><a name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>He
saw the couple enter the yard and proceed in the direction of the
front door.</p>
<p>It opened.</p>
<p>A woman&rsquo;s form stood there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome, Mr. Prescott.&nbsp; We heard the wheels and
were sure it was you.&nbsp; Welcome to your home, Mrs.
&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The rest died out as they went in, and the detective heard no
more.</p>
<p>He was amazed.&nbsp; How daring the artist was.&nbsp; How
openly he carried out his plans.</p>
<p>Most men would have taken a train and sped away like the wind,
fearing the terrible vengeance of an outraged husband.</p>
<p>He did not seem to realize the danger he incurred, or else had
a contempt for it.</p>
<p>Eric was in doubt whether this man was a fool or a brave
fellow.</p>
<p>Perhaps he was cunning enough to know that in all probability
the husband would seek for him at a distance, and overlook the
near places.&nbsp; This would be wisdom.</p>
<p>Eric now turned to the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, my fine fellow, I have your number, and if
you play me false I&rsquo;ll land you behind the bars inside of
twelve hours if it takes <a name="page251"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 251</span>every officer on the force to do
it.&nbsp; You hear what I am saying.&nbsp; Serve me well and what
I promised is yours.&nbsp; I have already paid you money
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly&mdash;I was the old man who rode up from
Fourteenth Street with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerusalem!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The driver saw that he had to deal with a shrewd man&mdash;he
admired such a person, and could well afford to fall in behind
him.</p>
<p>After that there would be no kick on his part against what
fate had decided for him, but he would pull in the traces
meekly.</p>
<p>Satisfied that the man would be there when he wanted him, Eric
now turned his attention toward the house.</p>
<p>He entered the gate.</p>
<p>As he had supposed from the glance he had obtained, the place
was an ideal one for the full expression of love in a
cottage.</p>
<p>Flowers probably bloomed here from May until bleak
November.</p>
<p>Honeysuckles and wisteria covered the cottage&mdash;rose
bushes and dozens of varieties of flowers filled the beds, but
just then beautiful <a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>chrysanthemums were taking their
rank as the fall flower.</p>
<p>It was a place to bring a bride, but would these beauties of
nature appeal to a heart that was heavy with sin?</p>
<p>Eric could not for the life of him see how one could look upon
nature again, after ruining the life of a noble man, but his
experience had taught him to be surprised at nothing.</p>
<p>He did not speculate now.</p>
<p>Before him was duty.</p>
<p>It lay in a direct line, and the path was narrow, but he meant
to tread it.</p>
<p>That duty covered his professional pride, and the feeling he
entertained for his friend.&nbsp; Straight up to the house he
went.&nbsp; Light streamed from the windows and showed him the
way&mdash;it also tempted him to look in.&nbsp; He saw a cozy
little room neatly furnished.</p>
<p>Handsome paintings adorned the walls, rather out of place in a
modest cottage like this, but then it was to be the abode of an
artist, whose pictures commanded large sums, and he could afford
to decorate above the ordinary&mdash;these were doubtless
favorite subjects of his which he did not hold for sale.</p>
<p><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>No
one seemed to be in this room, and he could not see in the other
well, for the lamp was standing directly in the window, so that
he could not look past it.</p>
<p>He found a path leading around the house and started along
it.</p>
<p>Before he had gone far, the rattle of a chain, followed by a
deep growl, told him he had better retrace his steps
again&mdash;not wishing to come into contact with the concealed
dog, he did so.</p>
<p>This time he went to the front door, which was almost
concealed under the bower of vines.</p>
<p>Feeling around he found the knob.&nbsp; Upon trying it he was
pleased to find that the door was not secured, and answered to
his touch.</p>
<p>He opened it boldly.&nbsp; A hall was before him.&nbsp; Just
then it was unoccupied, and the uninvited guest was able to step
in, close the door, and look around for some place of
concealment.&nbsp; This he easily found.</p>
<p>The hall offered numerous opportunities for hiding if one felt
inclined that way, and Eric speedily ensconced himself in a place
where he was not apt to be seen.&nbsp; He remained here awaiting
developments for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Nobody seemed to be moving.&nbsp; He heard <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>voices in
the room where the lamp in the window had prevented him from
seeing what the room contained.</p>
<p>One of these was the voice of Prescott.</p>
<p>The other seemed to belong to a man also, and Eric wondered at
this.</p>
<p>He had not supposed the artist would have a friend awaiting
him here&mdash;generally when a man runs off with another&rsquo;s
wife he desires to shun society of all sort.&nbsp; There was
reason enough for this, which made the action of the transgressor
the more peculiar.</p>
<p>He wondered whether there was not something about this whole
affair that he did not understand.</p>
<p>Later, he found out that this was so&mdash;that a man may see
all the surface indications and yet not get at the real facts in
the case.</p>
<p>He waited in his concealment for a while, and then made up his
mind to push matters.</p>
<p>Why should he not appear before Paul Prescott and boldly
announce his intention of wresting from his power the victim of
his spell?</p>
<p>There was nothing to prevent him.</p>
<p>He made his way toward the door that led from the hall into
the room, which as he afterward discovered was the library.</p>
<p><a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 255</span>A
<i>portiere</i> hung there in place of the door, and a more
excellent opportunity for hiding and spying could not well have
been offered.</p>
<p>Behind this he could find a small opening and thus see without
being seen.</p>
<p>When he looked into the room he found there were but two men
there.</p>
<p>One of these was Prescott&mdash;the other a small man of
severe countenance.</p>
<p>The first thought of the detective was that the latter had a
clerical look&mdash;his clothes seemed on the order of a
clergyman, white tie and all.</p>
<p>Then he concluded that he must be mistaken.&nbsp; Surely, a
minister would be the last one in all the world whom Prescott
would desire to have here.</p>
<p>This must be some friend whom he had asked to greet them at
the cottage in order to encourage Lillian.</p>
<p>The men were laughing.</p>
<p>Prescott seemed in unusual spirits.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had been imbibing&mdash;when a man in his sober
senses commits such a sin against society and his Maker he must,
generally, fortify himself with some ardent spirits.</p>
<p>At any rate he had the appearance of a man who was quite
satisfied with himself.</p>
<p><a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>The
world had abused him, in some respects, but to-night he was in a
humor to bid the whole universe defiance.</p>
<p>Success had come to him&mdash;the best he had ever dreamed of
was now at his hand.</p>
<p>Others before Paul Prescott had believed themselves on the
pinnacle of hope and power, only to find it all a dream and an
illusion.</p>
<p>So Darrell reflected as he watched the man whom he meant to
speedily humble.</p>
<p>While the two were yet talking, a door in the back part of the
library opened.</p>
<p>Through this came three females.&nbsp; The first one was very
like Prescott&mdash;indeed, it was easy for the detective to
determine that she must be the artist&rsquo;s sister.</p>
<p>After her came a sedate woman, neatly dressed, with her hair
parted and brushed straight back on either side&mdash;a model of
a housekeeper.</p>
<p>There was one more.</p>
<p>At sight of her Eric started, and an exclamation bubbled to
his lips.</p>
<p>She was dressed in white silk&mdash;the long cloak had been
discarded, and the heavy black veil that had screened her was now
supplanted by a gauzy white one, through which the faintest <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 257</span>glimpses
only could be seen of her face.&nbsp; She was a picture
indeed.</p>
<p>Eric held his breath.</p>
<p>He saw Prescott rush forward and take her hand with the utmost
eagerness.&nbsp; Then the other led her forward.&nbsp; They stood
in front of the second man, who held a book in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; muttered the detective.</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p>What mockery was this?&nbsp; A marriage&mdash;when she was
already another man&rsquo;s wife!&nbsp; He could hardly believe
his sight.</p>
<p>The voice of the preacher aroused him, and started him into
life.</p>
<p>This must not be.&nbsp; It was sacrilege.</p>
<p>Knowing the facts of the case he would be abetting a crime if
he allowed this thing to go on without raising an objection.</p>
<p>So, while the minister was still talking, Eric suddenly sprang
into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forbid this marriage!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>A scene of confusion followed.</p>
<p>The women fell back&mdash;Prescott swore and the minister
looked amazed.</p>
<p>An interruption like this seldom occurs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon
what charge do you dare stop this sacred ceremony?&rdquo;
demanded the preacher.</p>
<p><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>&ldquo;The woman has been married before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her husband is living!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this there came a shriek from the bride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is false, false as Hades!&nbsp; I helped to bury her
husband myself,&rdquo; shouted the artist.</p>
<p>Eric, with a quick movement, threw back the white veil from
the face of the almost fainting bride and then he received the
greatest shock of his life.</p>
<p>It was not Lillian!</p>
<h2><a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE MESSENGER WITH GOOD NEWS</span></h2>
<p>Eric Darrell might have been frozen&mdash;he seemed so
petrified with surprise.</p>
<p>Instead of Lillian&rsquo;s sweet face, marked by horror, he
saw that of the dashing widow, Mrs. Collingwood, she with whom
Prescott had communicated in the opium joint.</p>
<p>It dawned upon the detective.</p>
<p>All along there had been a great mistake&mdash;many things
remained to be explained away, but the one main point was
assured&mdash;Lillian must be innocent of the charge.</p>
<p>He was a man of extraordinary sense, as well as a man of
action.</p>
<p>Recovering himself, he turned gracefully to Paul Prescott, who
was glaring at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Prescott, there has been a grave mistake here on my
part.&nbsp; I thought this lady was some one else.&nbsp; I beg
your pardon.&nbsp; Let the ceremony proceed.&nbsp; I withdraw my
objection.&nbsp; When it is over we will have a mutual
understanding.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 260</span>These
words restored everyone to good humor.&nbsp; The artist dropped
his frown, the dominie found his place in the book, and the bride
again stood up beside the man she was taking for better or worse
and the ceremony went on.</p>
<p>Now was a chance for Eric to do some tall thinking, and he did
so.</p>
<p>He saw many things in a new light, and had about arranged all
he wanted to say when the marriage service was over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pronounce you man and wife,&rdquo; said the minister,
and, bending over, the artist kissed his bride.</p>
<p>Then the three females retired again, the preacher hurried
away, and Eric found himself alone with the man whom he had had
under surveillance for so long a time.</p>
<p>The artist eyed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a detective, Mr. Prescott&mdash;I have been in
your presence before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove! you are the man who bearded me in my
studio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and the man who rode up in the hack with you to
Eighty-fifth Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old gent with the cane?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>&ldquo;Also the friend of your driver who came up here
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you are hired by Colonel Rogers&mdash;but if so,
why the deuce did you stop the ceremony and then allow it to go
on?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The artist was amazed.</p>
<p>Well he might be.</p>
<p>The detective knew he had good reason for surprise, and was in
a measure ready to gratify that curiosity.</p>
<p>In return he hoped the artist would reveal certain strange
things to him.</p>
<p>So Eric told all that was necessary&mdash;he did not even
mention the lady&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Prescott smiled&mdash;he thought he could guess who it
referred to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you go to that house from here, my friend, you will
learn something,&rdquo; he said, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what does all this singular action of yours mean,
sir?&nbsp; You must admit everything seemed to prove you guilty,
even to the lady&rsquo;s initial, L.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name is Laura.&nbsp; As I said before, I was at the
burial of her first husband.&nbsp; The story is a long one and I
can only give you an outline of it&mdash;I might not do that only
that I feel in <a name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
262</span>such a jolly humor on this, my wedding night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jerry Collingwood and I were rivals&mdash;he won Laura
by a trick, and she found it out after her marriage, despising
him for it.&nbsp; Then came his tragic death, perhaps you
remember it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that, Laura went to live with her uncle, Colonel
Rogers&mdash;she found him a stern man, and he was soon plotting
against her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was strangely influenced by him&mdash;he had a
power over her, which he magnified in her mind, and she obeyed
him unquestioningly until by accident we met again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need not tell you all we passed through&mdash;Rogers
wished her to marry his son, and we finally realized that he
would give us trouble unless we took the bull by the horns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we arranged this elopement&mdash;how well it has
been carried out I leave to you to decide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura is now my wife&mdash;any man who dares to whisper
a word against her good name, were he a dozen times a colonel,
shall answer to me for it at the muzzle of the revolver.&nbsp; We
have outwitted the wily Rogers, and he will have to give an
account of his stewardship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>&ldquo;It is enough.&nbsp; Prescott, even when I had
reason to believe you guilty of the most heinous sin on the
calendar&mdash;that of stealing the affection of an honest
man&rsquo;s wife&mdash;there were points about you I
admired.&nbsp; Since learning what your true work was, I can say
without flattery that I am sincerely glad to know you&mdash;glad
that you have accomplished what you set out to perform, and trust
that your future as a Benedict may be free from
clouds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, sir.&nbsp; I have waited a long time for
Laura, but she is mine at last.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you stay and
break a bottle of champagne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks, but I must be off.&nbsp; I have another
engagement I must fill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can imagine where.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; dryly, &ldquo;and probably this will be as
happy a night to another man as it is to you&mdash;he has found a
wife as well as yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the lady you refer to is the sweetest and best
little woman in the world&mdash;save one&rdquo;&mdash;hastily
correcting himself&mdash;&ldquo;the man must be a fool who could
doubt her constancy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know all, Prescott.&nbsp; Her husband
is the truest, noblest man I know.&nbsp; He rejected it all again
and again, but he is human and he <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>saw and heard things that would
convince a skeptic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably he understands all by this time, and he will
eat humble pie too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so.&nbsp; Good night, Mr. Prescott.&nbsp; Bring
the doughty colonel to his knees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wring his nose if he gives me any further
trouble, the old nuisance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Success to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eric Darrell left the vine-embowered cottage with feelings
greatly differing from his entrance.&nbsp; He was light of
heart.</p>
<p>Not only was this on account of Joe and his wife, but his
faith in womankind had been saved.</p>
<p>Had Lillian been guilty Eric was determined never again to
believe in a woman.</p>
<p>This would have made him a cynic and a scoffer all of his
days&mdash;now he could remember with a delicious thrill that
Marian was at Joe&rsquo;s house, and he would soon meet the
original of the picture that had charmed him so.</p>
<p>He did not remember of having felt so good for a long time
back.</p>
<p>That was the result of the reaction.</p>
<p>As yet he could form no distinct idea of the true state of
affairs&mdash;all was chaotic confusion, <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>but above
everything he saw the prime fact that Lillian was innocent.</p>
<p>That covered all.</p>
<p>How Joe must rejoice.</p>
<p>It would be a new lease of life to him.</p>
<p>So the detective walked out to the street, and found the hack
waiting.</p>
<p>The driver greeted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you on deck&mdash;it was a mistake after
all.&nbsp; Now drive me to the corner you brought me from and the
fee is yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away they rattled.</p>
<p>The detective felt inclined to smoke, and was soon puffing a
cigar out of the window, as he did not want to saturate his
clothes with the strong odor, fearing lest Marian might be one
with her sister in objecting to tobacco.</p>
<p>Then he wondered what time it was.</p>
<p>They had started at ten minutes to ten and made wonderful
time, so that it could not be very late, he thought.</p>
<p>Taking out his watch as they crossed the bridge over the
Harlem, he found that it was fifteen minutes after eleven.</p>
<p>Would he be in time?</p>
<p><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>He
did not know how long these informal affairs were apt to last,
but at a rough guess figured that they would still be on hand at
midnight and he ought to be there before that.</p>
<p>He urged the driver on.</p>
<p>Finally the vehicle drew up.&nbsp; They had arrived.&nbsp;
When Eric found that it lacked fifteen minutes of twelve, he was
satisfied, handed the driver his fee, and hurried along the
street.</p>
<p>He drew near the house.</p>
<p>Lights still shone in every window.&nbsp; Something caused him
to feel very queerly&mdash;he could not say what it was.</p>
<p>Did Joe know all?</p>
<p>Perhaps not&mdash;he might still be in a fog and wondering why
all the plans had miscarried.&nbsp; Eric did not hesitate.</p>
<p>He immediately ran up the steps.</p>
<p>Then he noticed that the parlor was deserted&mdash;the good
people could not have gone, for he could hear the laughter and
buzz of voices&mdash;ah! they were doubtless in the diningroom
below.</p>
<p>He rang the bell.</p>
<p>A colored man answered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;1 wish to see Mr. Leslie on important business.&nbsp;
Take my card to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>The
man knew his business, closed the door and went away with the
card.</p>
<p>One, two minutes passed.</p>
<p>Then Eric heard footsteps within.</p>
<p>The door opened.</p>
<p>There could be no mistaking that figure&mdash;it was Joe who
stood there.</p>
<p>Eric&rsquo;s eyes sought his face instantly&mdash;he saw a
look of mute pain there which told him better than words that Joe
did not yet know the truth.</p>
<h2><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
268</span>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>At sight of his friend Joe held out his hand warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eric, old man, I have wondered where you have
been.&nbsp; Everything has gone wrong.&nbsp; She is still here,
and yet the hour is long past&mdash;that villain must have backed
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he carried out his plans to the letter; he had his
carriage waiting, ran off with a lady at ten o&rsquo;clock, at
eleven was married to her in a cottage beyond the Harlem, and is
now a Benedict as well as yourself, Joe&mdash;but it was not your
wife he was after.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not my wife?&rdquo; slowly, as though the wonderful
news almost paralyzed his brain&mdash;&ldquo;not Lillian he
sought?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe, it was all a terrible, a cruel mistake which
fortune put upon you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens! do you mean it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lillian, your sweet wife, is as innocent as you ever
believed her in your most charitable <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>moods.&nbsp; That I will swear
to&mdash;you will learn all before this night is over, and I
believe the mystery of the locked trunk will be revealed.&nbsp;
Just now I am famished for a bite to eat and a cup of the coffee
I get a scent of.&nbsp; Suppose you invite me in&mdash;I am not
in evening dress, but a few minutes in your room will arrange my
toilet and make me presentable.&nbsp; I want to see this thing
out&mdash;to rejoice with you, old boy, over the wife you thought
you had lost but who is found again.&nbsp; Besides, you know, I
want to meet Marian, and I know she is here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What could Joe do?</p>
<p>He dragged his friend upstairs and himself assisted to brush
him into presentable shape.</p>
<p>Ten minutes were consumed thus, and then Eric was ready to go
down.</p>
<p>All this while Joe had plied him with questions and the
detective told a good deal of what had happened to him.</p>
<p>There were some things of which he would not speak, however,
and hence Joe found himself in a state bordering on bewilderment
when he finally went downstairs.</p>
<p>By this time the guests had finished supper and were again
flocking into the parlors.</p>
<p><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>There
were between twenty-five and thirty in all.</p>
<p>Eric was introduced all around.</p>
<p>He noticed that there was some little secret among a number of
those present&mdash;Lillian, all blushes and confusion, was being
consulted by an old gentleman with a white beard.</p>
<p>Although Eric had declared he was almost famished he would not
leave the rooms now for supper&mdash;something was on the
<i>tapis</i>, and he was bound to see it out.</p>
<p>Supper could wait.</p>
<p>Ah! it came at last.</p>
<p>The elderly gentleman rapped on a table.&nbsp; Silence
ensued.</p>
<p>All eyes were bent on him, all but those of Joe Leslie, and
his blazing orbs rested on the blushing face of
Lillian&mdash;before he learned all he wanted to prove that he no
longer entertained the slightest suspicion regarding her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Friends, we have spent a very pleasant evening at the
house of our neighbor&mdash;we all cherish Joe Leslie and his
charming wife as among those whose names will never leave the
tablets of our memory&mdash;a devoted couple, loving, kind and
gentle, whom it is an honor to know.</p>
<p><a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>&ldquo;Before we part to-night, it is my pleasure to
officiate at a little surprise&mdash;I am going to let our friend
Leslie see himself as others see him&mdash;in brief, I shall
introduce him to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My grandchild Barbara and Mrs. Leslie have always
possessed an artistic temperament.&nbsp; They consulted with me
about it, and I took some of their amateur work to a friend who
is a well-known artist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The upshot of it all is that for a month past Barbara
has been flitting over here at ten o&rsquo;clock every morning
through the gate we have in our back fence, and the two have been
taking lessons in painting with astonishing success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This evening I was astonished to find a fine oil
painting of myself, true to nature, on my drawing-room
wall&mdash;I had not dreamed my grandchild was so gifted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now for our fair Lillian&rsquo;s birthday gift to
her husband&mdash;bring them forth, friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out from the mysterious closet came two gold-framed
paintings&mdash;they were placed on easels prepared for them, in
front of the astonished Joe.</p>
<p>The faces were those of himself and his wife, astonishingly
well done.</p>
<p>He hardly glanced at his own, but his eyes <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>were glued
upon the counterfeit resemblance of his dear wife&mdash;done by
her hand too.</p>
<p>Eric was amazed.</p>
<p>He looked from the painting to the original&mdash;the work was
no amateurish daub, but worthy of a master.</p>
<p>Could it be possible she had painted it?&nbsp; She was a
genius.</p>
<p>At first delighted expressions arose, and then, as the old
gentleman raised his hand, these died away again.</p>
<p>All eyes were turned upon Joe.</p>
<p>He stood there as if petrified&mdash;his eyes were glued upon
the picture of his wife, and he hardly seemed to breathe.</p>
<p>Then he slowly turned his gaze upon the same face in flesh and
blood.</p>
<p>She looked at him, still blushing&mdash;tears were in her
sweet eyes&mdash;she smiled through them.</p>
<p>Joe forgot where he was&mdash;he only remembered that he had
wronged that dear little woman by harboring thoughts that
reflected on her love and purity of heart.</p>
<p>Another instant he was at her side, had clasped her hand, and
falling on his knees before her, kissed the little member whose
cunning had wrought such wonders upon the canvas.</p>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>The
others believed it was mute adoration that took him to her
feet&mdash;regard for genius&mdash;and they thought all the more
of Joe Leslie because he could appreciate a gift as well as a
good wife.</p>
<p>There was one present who knew what was in Joe&rsquo;s mind as
he bent his head before his wife, unable to speak, though his
lips moved as they formed the word &ldquo;forgive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To cover Joe&rsquo;s terrible confusion Eric made some remark
appropriate to the occasion, and of a nature to create a
laugh.</p>
<p>This answered the purpose and presently the good people were
chatting gaily.</p>
<p>Joe soon found occasion to seek his friend Eric, and squeeze
his hand until the detective winced under the pressure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven, Eric, for this blessing.&nbsp; All is
bright again.&nbsp; I have the dearest wife in all New York
to-night.&nbsp; Tried and found true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she has a deuced fine sister too,&rdquo; said Eric
with a wink.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way the land lies, eh?&nbsp; Try it,
old fellow.&nbsp; Nothing would suit me better; we would be
brothers in truth then.&nbsp; And I declare, now that I come to
think of it, I believe you two would make a fine
match.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>&ldquo;Nonsense, Joe.&nbsp; When Miss Marian hears that
I am a detective she will shrink from me.&nbsp; People honor
judges who sentence people to death, sometimes innocently, and
great lawyers, who are often on the side of criminals, but at the
same time pretend to look down on the officers of the law whose
sagacity leads them to arrest those who break the statutes of the
state.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that&mdash;she adores a hero
in any type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t you go to making me out as
such&mdash;I&rsquo;m only an every-day chap and never expect to
do anything heroic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save your worry.&nbsp; If I tell her anything at all it
will only be the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As it turned out, Miss Marion was rather capricious&mdash;she
heard Joe tell long yarns of his friend&rsquo;s bravery, she
respected him as a man, even while openly disliking his
profession, but Eric soon saw she was giving him no sort of
encouragement.</p>
<p>This was hard because he was already deeply in love with the
girl.</p>
<p>He went his way, taking his disappointment as best he
could&mdash;they met occasionally, but Eric did not pursue the
game.</p>
<p><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>One
night when Joe and the two ladies were on the way home in a
street car, it was suddenly halted&mdash;there was a fire
ahead.</p>
<p>Marian had never seen a large fire and Joe, good-natured
always, readily agreed to take them where they could have a
view.</p>
<p>The giant shouldered a way for them through the crowd, and
soon they stood in a doorway watching the flames play riot with
the tenement near by.</p>
<p>It was a terrible sight and a pitiful one to those who looked
on&mdash;many poor families were driven out, carrying what they
could lay hands on, one a trunk, another a feather bed, and a
third some old gowns.</p>
<p>Fright made their faces wrinkled, and such looks the ladies
had never seen before.&nbsp; Suddenly a cry went up.</p>
<p>The flames were roaring, engines pumping and much noise
sounding, but this shriek pierced the hearts of all&mdash;it was
a mother&rsquo;s wail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child! my child&mdash;save her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All eyes were fastened upon a window up in the third story
where the face of a flaxen-haired little girl
appeared&mdash;blanched with fear, and yet curious to see what
was going on.</p>
<p><a name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>The
ladder wagon had not arrived, and the flames were devouring the
frail tenement.</p>
<p>Surely the child was lost&mdash;no one could save her
there.&nbsp; It was an awful period of suspense to the thousands
who looked on.&nbsp; Lillian and her sister held their breath and
leaned on Joe for support.</p>
<p>Then the child vanished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens! she has gone&mdash;the floor has probably
fallen in,&rdquo; gasped Joe.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, look! there is
a man at the window&mdash;he has seized the child and is tying
her to himself.&nbsp; Look! he climbs out of the windows.&nbsp;
Ugh! if he loses his grip both will be dashed to
pieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They gaze as if fascinated, both of the gentle ladies praying
for the daring man&rsquo;s success.</p>
<p>He swings himself boldly along the ledge&mdash;none but a
quick-witted man could have seen the chance that existed, but he
had.</p>
<p>Reaching a certain spot he took hold of the pipe that ran down
the building&mdash;it must have burned his hands, but he lowered
himself by it to the floor below.</p>
<p>Flames were beneath, but he had arranged his plan&mdash;a tall
telegraph pole slanted in here and a dexterous man could leap in
among <a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>its numerous arms&mdash;he coolly calculated his
chances and sprang out.</p>
<p>There was a cry of horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is down&mdash;no, no, by Jove, he clings there with
one hand.&nbsp; See how bravely he exerts himself&mdash;as cool
as a cucumber through all.&nbsp; Now he seizes a new support; he
will slide down the pole.&nbsp; Hurrah! both are safe, thank
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then Joe turned to Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that man?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a hero&mdash;I love him,&rdquo; she said
impulsively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&nbsp; I shall let him know that fact some
day.&nbsp; Here he comes now with the child on his shoulder, his
face blackened, his hair scorched, but, thank God, the same Eric
as of old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man passed them by&mdash;it was Eric Darrell!</p>
<p>Marian turned white and then rosy red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe,&rdquo; she said almost fiercely, &ldquo;if you
ever repeat my words, I&rsquo;ll&mdash;go back to
Chicago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether Joe repeated them or not no one ever knew, but Eric
heard enough to encourage him to renew his suit, and when Marian
did return to Chicago it was as Mrs. Darrell.</p>
<p>They are just as happy as Joe and Lillian&mdash;<a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>Eric is no
longer a detective, but has been studying for a doctor, as his
wife believes he will make a name in the profession.&nbsp; She
will never forget watching him save the widow&rsquo;s child at
the risk of his life&mdash;outwardly she loves him as a true
wife, but in secret she adores her Eric as a hero of heroes.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
